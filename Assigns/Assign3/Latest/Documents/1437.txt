Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura
Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura (aka Arcanum) is a single player computer role-playing game developed by Troika Games and published by Sierra Entertainment. It was released in North America and Europe in August, 2001 for Microsoft Windows. Debuting at fourth position on NPD Intelect's best-seller list,[2] 234,000 copies of Arcanum have since been sold,[3] with takings of $8.8 million,[4] it was Troika's best-selling title.
Despite the large number of bugs in the game, a problem common to all of Troika's titles[5], reviews have been mostly positive, with IGN scoring it 8.7[6] and conferring the IGN Editors' Choice Award on 24 August 2001. PC Gamer and GameZone awarded Arcanum 90 out of 100,[7] with the latter also conferring its Editors' Choice accolade. The Electric Playground awarded the game 9 out of 10, calling it "the most diverse and open-ended RPG to date."[8] The game currently holds an average review score of 79% on GameRankings[9] and 81% on Metacritic[10].
The story takes place on the continent of Arcanum, which despite its initial fantasy setting has just started going through an industrial revolution[11]. The story begins with the crash of the zeppelin IFS Zephyr, of which the protagonist is the only survivor, which leads him throughout the land in search of answers[12]. The game employs an isometric perspective and features an open game world where the protagonist can travel unhindered.

Gameplay in Arcanum consists of travelling through the game world, visiting locations and interacting with the local inhabitants, typically in real-time. Occasionally, inhabitants will require the player's assistance in various tasks, which the player may choose to solve in order to acquire special items, experience points or new followers. Many quests offer multiple solutions for the player, depending on his playing style, which may consist of combat, persuasion, thievery or bribery.[5] Ultimately, players will encounter hostile opponents (if such encounters are not avoided using stealth or diplomacy), in which case they and the player will engage in combat, which can be real-time or turn-based.

Arcanum begins with the player creating their character, choosing from a large variety of races, attributes, technological skills, magical aptitudes and background traits or the player may choose a pre-defined character. Over the course of the game, the character may improve his or her skills by gaining experience through completing quests or defeating opponents in combat[13]. The player can only control one character directly, but may recruit additional followers during the game depending on his aptitudes and alignment.

Three combat modes were included in the final release of the game: real-time, turn-based and a faster version of turn-based. Arcanum's combat design has received criticism, with reviews stating that it is poorly balanced and frantic[14][15] and overly simplified. The player's combat capabilities are in large part governed by the character's combat skills and weapons. Attacking is performed automatically by clicking on a hostile NPC provided that he is in range of the attack. Real-time combat resembles action RPGs such as Diablo and the turn-based mode is in the same vein as the Fallout games.[16]
Combat skills that the player character can choose from include melee weapons (with an optional backstab skill for stealth-oriented players), thrown weapons, archery, firearms and certain damage-inflicting spells from some schools of magic. Deciding whether or not to use violence in the game sometimes carries consequences for the player's party. Some AI-controlled followers the player makes will find their character's conduct morally objectionable, and leave, or even attack the player.[17]

Arcanum's large, free-form world bears many similarities to Fallout with regards to the sparsity of towns, cities or other locations of interest, however Arcanum's map is much larger than Fallout's due to the fact that it takes place on an entire continent rather than a limited stretch of coastline. The travel system however has some things in common with the Elder Scrolls series in that the world can be travelled across in-game, without the use of the world map, and that the game doesn't rush the player into pursuing the main quest[18].


Arcanum begins with a cutscene of the IFS Zephyr, a luxury zeppelin, on her maiden voyage from Caladon to Tarant. Two monoplanes, piloted by Half-Ogre Bandits, shortly close in on the craft and commence attack runs, succeeding in shooting it down. A passenger aboard the Zephyr, an odd-looking gnome, now in his death throes under charred debris, tells the player to bring a silver ring to "the boy", and promptly dies. A robed figure walks among the debris to the player.
Virgil, a robed wayfarer, appears. In utter exasperation, having to rationalise the idea to himself first, he gingerly confirms that the player is the "Living One".

Arcanum is an example of a non-linear role-playing game. At various points throughout the game, players may take the story in different directions, sometimes permanently removing different paths of action. The game's central quest ultimately develops according to how players navigate its dichotomies, the most apparent being that of magic and technology.

Arcanum is the name of the fantasy world in which the game unfolds. It consists of a continental mainland and three islands. The player is at liberty to explore the mainland, their coverage partly being governed by the quests they choose to undertake. The three islandsâ€”the Isle of Despair, Thanatos and Half Ogre Islandâ€”become available only upon initiating particular quests.
An important in-game dynamic maintains that while Technology utilizes physical law to produce a desired result, Magick manipulates physical law to do so. Thus, the two are incompatible to the point that they overwhelm each other â€“ technological devices will become inefficient or even permanently inoperative in the presence of powerful magicks and vice versa. Much of the population (aside from most Elves) has chosen to embrace technology for its efficiency, accessibility and permanent results. To further impress upon the player the opposition of these forces, a player-character with high scientific skills will have little to no success using spells and enchanted items and will be less or even completely unaffected by them; one with similarly high magical skills will have similar problems with technological devices. This is an important factor in combat â€“ Opponents of opposing inclinations will actually have greater difficulty inflicting damage upon each other (though this effect is less noticeable when using the most potent resources).
The delicate relationship between the magickal establishments and the nascent technologies of industrialization affects Arcanum on social, geopolitical and legal levels.
This shift is dynamic to the politics of Arcanum. There is a great enmity between elves and dwarves, the former being naturally inclined towards magickally-defined society, the latter being forerunners of the technology race â€“ and many of the former blame the latter for the rise of human technology. Scientists are unwelcome in magickal societies like Qintarra or Tulla, but will be respected if they are righteous and good folk. Conversely, a mage would be admitted onto a steam train only on the provision that he take a third-class seat on the last caboose, so as not to cause interference with the engine(despite there being no in-game mechanic by which even the powerful mages can affect it, making the custom similar to how electronic devices are treated on real-world aircraft). Powerful mages may be denied transport altogether. (There is, however, a teleport spell available to mages of sufficient power.)
Orcs and Ogres alike are looked down upon as savage, feral peoples by Arcanum's civilized folk, who own virtually all the industry of the major population centres. Half-breeds inhabit the world as a result of humanity reproducing with anything possible (and not always as willing participants).

The game's races are typically Tolkienian in design, but the way they relate to the world and its other inhabitants imbues them with great degree of realism. The dwarven clans are prone to factional infighting; the elves are separated into two societies due to a political schism ages past. Ethnopolitics features in subquests, NPC dialogues and in-game literature.


Despite its being called a kingdom, the Unified Kingdom is ruled by a council instead of a monarch, a misnomer attributable to Tarantâ€™s old kingdom status. The UK lays claim to the Morbihan Plains, due south of the Grey Mountains and east of Stonewall Range. Membership in the UK brings rapid industrialisation, coverage by the Tarant-based UK rail transport network and free trade with other Kingdom members.

A decrepit husk of its former self, Cumbria retains whatever meagre districts of the south-eastern mainland not already claimed by the UK. Due to King Praetor's conservatism over issues of technological reform, he is regarded as old and deluded by those outside the ailing kingdom. Most of Cumbria's infrastructure has been long neglected, due not only to its industrial policy, but also a plague it suffered some years earlier.

A small but thriving monarchy west of the Stonewall range, the Kingdom of Arland is the only realistic rival to the UK, but nevertheless applying for UK membership, seeking the increased wealth and prosperity it brings.

The Glimmering Forest is the largest forest in Arcanum. It also seems to be imbued with magickal forces, as even the most aggressive wildlife is passive unless attacked. Within it lies the cities of Qintarra and T'sen-Ang.

A snow-capped mountain range that spans from the sea at its southern terminus to the Grey Mountains at the northern, Stonewall Range, as per the name, isolates south-east Arcanum from the rest of the world. Stonewall's topography is harsh, with the few traversable routes inhabited by aggressive wildlife. Some of the dwarven clans have made homes in the caverns along the range, and believe themselves blessed, for in the common Arcanum creation myth, their god Alberich is the land itself, and they are special for being the only
