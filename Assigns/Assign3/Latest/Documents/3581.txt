Fight Club (film)
Fight Club is a 1999 American feature film adaptation of the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. The film was directed by David Fincher and follows a nameless protagonist (Edward Norton), an everyman and an unreliable narrator who feels trapped with his white-collar position in society. The narrator gets involved in a fight club with soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and becomes tangled up in a relationship triangle with Durden and a destitute woman, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter).
Palahniuk's novel was optioned by producer Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls to write the script for the film. Several directors were sought to film Fight Club; David Fincher was hired to direct based on his interest in the project despite his previous difficulties with the studio 20th Century Fox. Fincher worked with Uhls to develop the script, seeking advice from others in the film industry and his own cast members. Fincher described Fight Club as black comedy that applies heavy satire; he and the cast also compared the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967). Thematically, the film was intended to represent the conflict between a generation of young people and the value system of advertising. The film's use of violence in the fight clubs was intended to serve as a metaphor for feeling based on the generation's conflict. The director carried homoerotic overtones over from Palahniuk's novel to implement in the film, believing that the overtones would make audiences uncomfortable and thereby keep them from anticipating the twist ending.
Studio executives were not receptive to the film, and they altered Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to recoup perceived losses. Fight Club failed to meet expectations at the box office, and the film received polarized reactions from film critics. The film was cited as one of the most controversial and talked-about films of 1999. It was perceived as ground-breaking for its visual style in cinema and presaging a new mood in American political life. The film later found commercial success with its DVD release, which established Fight Club as a cult film. The film has also permeated American society, inspiring people to set up fight clubs.

The narrator (Edward Norton) is an automobile company employee who travels to accident sites to perform product recall cost appraisals. His doctor refuses to write a prescription for his insomnia and instead suggests that he visit a support group for testicular cancer victims in order to appreciate real suffering. When he attends the group, the narrator allows himself to weep as a form of emotional release. He is then able to sleep soundly and subsequently fakes more illnesses so he can attend other support groups in order to get out his pent up emotions through crying. The narrator's routine is disrupted when he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), at the same meetings and his insomnia returns.
During a flight for a business trip, the narrator meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who makes and sells soap. The narrator arrives home to find his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. He calls Tyler and meets him at a bar. Tyler agrees to let the narrator stay at his home on the condition that the narrator hits him. The narrator complies and the two end up enjoying a fist fight outside the bar. The narrator moves into Tyler's dilapidated house and the two return to the bar, where they have another fight in the parking lot. After attracting a crowd, they establish a 'fight club' in the bar's basement.
When Marla overdoses on Xanax, she is rescued by Tyler and the two embark upon a sexual relationship. Tyler tells the narrator never to talk about him to Marla. Under Tyler's leadership, the fight club becomes "Project Mayhem," which commits increasingly destructive acts of anti-materialist vandalism in the city. The fight clubs become a network for Project Mayhem, and the narrator is left out of Tyler's activities with the project. After an argument, Tyler disappears from the narrator's life and when a member of Project Mayhem dies on a mission, the narrator attempts to shut down the project. Tracing Tyler's steps, he travels around the country to find that fight clubs have been started in every major city, where one of the participants identifies him as Tyler Durden. A phone call to Marla confirms his identity and he realizes that Tyler is an alter ego of his own split personality. Tyler appears before him and explains that he controls the narrator's body whenever he is asleep.
The narrator faints and awakes to find Tyler has made several phone calls during his blackout and traces his plans to the downtown headquarters of several major credit card companies, which Tyler intends to destroy in order to cripple the financial networks. Failing to find help with the police, many of whom are members of Project Mayhem, the narrator attempts to disarm the explosives in the basement of one of the buildings. He is confronted by Tyler, knocked unconscious, and taken to the upper floor of another building to witness the impending destruction. The narrator, held by Tyler at gunpoint, realizes that in sharing the same body with Tyler, he is the one who is actually holding the gun. He fires it into his mouth, shooting through the cheek without killing himself. The illusion of Tyler collapses with an exit wound to the back of his head. Shortly after, members of Project Mayhem bring a kidnapped Marla to the narrator and leave them alone. The bombs detonate and, holding hands, the two witness the destruction of the entire financial city block through the windows.


In 1996, a 20th Century Fox book scout sent a galley proof of Chuck Palahniuk's novel Fight Club to creative executive Kevin McCormick. Despite a studio reader discouraging a film adaptation of the material, McCormick passed the proof on to producers Lawrence Bender and Art Linson, who in turn also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell then expressed interest in the project and arranged unpaid screen readings with actors, initially lasting six hours, to determine the length of a script. After cutting out sections to reduce the running time and recording the dialogue, Bell sent the book on tape to Laura Ziskin, head of the division Fox 2000, who after listening to the tape purchased the rights to Fight Club for $10,000.[1]
To adapt the story into a screenplay, Ziskin initially considered hiring Buck Henry; Ziskin thought that Fight Club was similar to The Graduate, which had been adapted by Henry. However, a new screenwriter, Jim Uhls, began lobbying Donen and Bell to be hired to adapt the screenplay and was subsequently chosen by the producers over Henry. For directing, Bell had four options in mind: Peter Jackson, Bryan Singer, Danny Boyle, and David Fincher. Bell considered Jackson the best choice and contacted the director, but Jackson was too busy filming The Frighteners (1996) in New Zealand. Singer received the book, but did not read it, while Boyle met with Bell and read the book, he ultimately pursued another project. Fincher, who had previously read the book and tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film, but was hesitant to work with 20th Century Fox again after his bad experiences with the studio during AlienÂ³ (1992). A meeting with Ziskin and studio head Bill Mechanic restored his relationship with the studio,[1] and in August 1997, 20th Century Fox announced that Fincher would helm the film adaptation of the novel.[2] Mechanic and Ziskin initially planned to finance the film with a $23 million budget.[1]

Producer Ross Bell met with actor Russell Crowe to discuss portraying Tyler Durden, while at the same time producer Art Linson, who had lately joined the project, was negotiating with Brad Pitt for the same role. Due to Linson's seniority, Pitt was cast over Crowe.[1] Pitt, who was seeking a new project after the failure of his previous film, Meet Joe Black (1998), was hired for $17.5 million, the studio believing that Fight Club would be more commercially successful with a major star.[3] Likewise for the role of the nameless narrator, the studio desired a "sexier marquee name" like Matt Damon to increase the film's visibility (Sean Penn was also considered), but Fincher sought to cast Edward Norton in that role, based on the actor's performance in The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996).[4] Norton had also been approached by other studios for leading roles in films like The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) and Man on the Moon (1999), and he temporarily pursued Runaway Jury (2003) before that project fell apart. To lure him away from the other projects, Fox offered Norton a salary of $2.5 million, but Norton could not immediately accept, as he still owed Paramount Pictures a film. Norton therefore signed a new contract with Paramount for a lesser salary, eventually being contractually obligated to take a role in The Italian Job (2003).[3] In January 1998, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton officially joined the project to portray Tyler Durden and the nameless narrator, respectively.[5]
Actresses Courtney Love and Winona Ryder were considered to portray Marla Singer,[6] and the studio would have cast Reese Witherspoon were it not for Fincher's objections that the actress was too young.[3] Ultimately, Helena Bonham Carter was cast in the role, based on her performance in The Wings of the Dove (1997).[7]
To prepare for their roles, Norton and Pitt took lessons in boxing, taekwondo, and grappling,[8] in addition to soapmaking classes from boutique company owner Auntie Godmother.[9] For the cosmetics of his role, Pitt voluntarily visited a dentist to have pieces of his front teeth chipped off, which were restored after filming concluded.[10]

Screenwriter Jim Uhls began working on the adaptation from an earlier draft which lacked a voice-over due to the industry's perspective at the time that the technique was "hackneyed and trite". When Fincher joined the project, he disagreed with the approach, believing that the film's humor came from the narrator's voice,[3] and described the film without voice-over as seemingly "sad and pathetic".[11] The director and Uhls developed the script for six to seven months, creating a third draft by 1997 that reordered the story and left out several major elements. When Pitt came on board, the actor expressed concern that Tyler Durden was too one-dimensional, so Fincher sought the advice of writer-director Cameron Crowe, who suggested giving the character more ambiguity. Fincher also hired screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker and invited Pitt and Norton to collaborate on rewriting the script, which was completed after a year of work and five drafts.[3] The narrator was written to be nameless in the film, although he is identified in the script as Jack. The narrator's aliases in the support groups that he attends were based on characters from Planet of the Apes and Robert De Niro roles of the 1970s.[12]
Author Chuck Palahniuk praised the faithful film adaptation of his novel Fight Club and applauded the fact that the plot of the film was more streamlined than that of the book. Palahniuk also noted the contention over the believability for film audiences of the novel's plot twist, the inclusion of which director David Fincher supported by saying, "If they accept everything up to this point, they'll accept the plot twist. If they're still in the theater, they'll stay with it." Palahniuk was, however, annoyed by the film's change of a single ingredient in its explanation on making napalm, which rendered the recipe useless, since the author had researched the components extensively.[13] Palahniuk's novel also contained homoerotic overtones, which the director deliberately included in the film in order to make audiences uncomfortable and thereby accentuate the surprise of the film's twists and turns.[14] The scene in which Tyler Durden bathes next to the narrator is an example of such overtones, although Durden's insight in the scene, "I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need," was meant to suggest personal responsibility rather than homosexuality.[15] Another example of the overtones was the scene at the beginning of the film in which Tyler Durden puts a gun barrel down the narrator's mouth.[16]
At the end of the film, the narrator finds redemption in rejecting Tyler Durden's dialectic, which is a divergence from the novel's end, in which the narrator is placed in a mental institution.[17] Norton notes the film's redemptive parallel to The Graduate, as the protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self.[18] The director also considered the novel too infatuated with Tyler Durden and altered the ending to pull away from him, saying, "I wanted people to love Tyler, but I also wanted them to be OK with his vanquishing."[17]

When production first began, the initial $50 million budget, of which half was paid by New Regency, escalated to a peak of $67 million. New Regency's head and Fight Club executive producer Arnon Milchan petitioned Fincher to reduce the budget by at least $5 million, but the director refused to cut costs, so Milchan contacted studio head Bill Mechanic, saying that he would back out. To bring back Milchan's support, Mechanic sent him tapes of dailies, and after three weeks of shooting, Milchan returned his support and financed half of the production budget.[19]
Filming lasted 138 days,[20] during which Fincher shot more than 1,500 rolls of film, three times the average for a Hollywood film.[8] Filming locations were in and around Los Angeles and on sets built at the studio's location in Century City.[20] Production designer Alex McDowell constructed more than 70 sets.[8] The exterior of Tyler Durden's home on Paper Street was built in San Pedro, California, while the interiors, given a decayed look to reflect the deconstructed world of the characters, were built on a sound stage at the studio's location.[20] Marla's apartment was based on photographs of the Rosalind Apartments in downtown L.A.[11]
Fighting in the film was heavily choreographed, and fighters were required to "go full out" during fight scenes to capture realistic effects such as having the wind knocked out of oneself.[21] To enhance the scenes, makeup artist Julie Pearce, who collaborated with the director on The Game, studied mixed martial arts and pay-per-view boxing for her work on the fighters. She also designed an extra to have a chunk missing from his ear, for which she cited Mike Tyson's bite as inspiration.[22] To create sweat on cue, makeup artists devised two methods: spraying water over a coat of Vaseline, and using straight water for "wet sweat". Meat Loaf, who plays a member of the fight club who has "bitch tits", wore a 90-pound (40 kg) fat harness that gave him large breasts for the role.[8] He also wore eight-inch (20 cm) lifts in his scenes with Norton, being shorter than the lead actor.[15]
Overall production included 300 scenes, 200 locations, and complex special effects. Fincher compared Fight Club to his succeeding and less complex project Panic Room (2002), "I felt like I was spending all my time watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so I could shoot three lines of dialogue. There was far too much transportation going on."[23]

Fight Club was shot in the Super 35 format to give the director maximum flexibility in composing shots. To direct the cinematography for the film, director David Fincher hired Jeff Cronenweth, the son of the late cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth with whom Fincher had collaborated for AlienÂ³ (1992). Fincher and Cronenweth drew from elements of the visual styles that Fincher had begun exploring in Se7en and The Game. For the narrator's scenes without Tyler Durden, the look was purposely bland and realistic, while for scenes with Tyler, Fincher chose a look that was "more hyper-real in a torn-down, deconstructed senseâa visual metaphor of what [the narrator is] heading into". Heavily desaturated colors were used in the costuming, makeup, and art direction, and the crew took advantage of as much natural and practical light at filming locations as possible. The director also took various approaches to take advantage of lighting situations in the film's scenes, and several practical locations were chosen for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. Fluorescent lighting at practical locations was also embraced to maintain an element of reality and to light the prosthetics of the characters' injuries appropriately.[20] On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were darkened enough to reduce the visibility of the characters' eyes, citing cinematographer Gordon Willis's technique as the influence.[15]
The majority of Fight Club was filmed at night, with daytime shots taking place in purposely shadowed locations. For the first scenes of the actual indoor fight club in Lou's basement, the area was lit by inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. The director also chose to film fight scenes in the basement from a more objective view, purposely avoiding stylish camerawork and instead placing the camera in a fixed position. As the fight scenes in the film progressed, the camera moved from the point of view of a distant observer to that of the fighter.[20]
Scenes of Tyler Durden were staged to conceal the film's twist; the character was not filmed in two shots with a group of people, nor was he shown in any over the shoulder shots in scenes where Tyler gives the narrator specific ideas that are going to "lead him". Durden is also present in single frames of the narrator's scenes before the narrator actually meets Durden,[11] appearing in the background and out of focus, like a "little devil on the shoulder".[15] Regarding these subliminal frames, Fincher explained, "Our hero is creating Tyler Durden in his own mind, so at this point he exists only on the periphery of the narrator's consciousness."[24]

As visual effects supervisor, Kevin Tod Haug, who had collaborated with director David Fincher on The Game, divided the VFX artists and experts into different facilities, each responsible for addressing a separate aspect of the film's visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and scanning. According to Haug, "We selected the best people for each aspect of the effects work, then coordinated their efforts. In this way, we never had to play to a facility's weakness." Fincher chose to illustrate the nameless narrator's perspective with a "mind's eye" view and to create a myopic framework for the film's audience. Fincher also utilized previsualized footage of challenging main-unit and visual effects shots as a problem-solving tool to avoid making mistakes during the actual filming.[24]
The film's title sequence is a 90-second pullback scene from the fear center of the narrator's brain, representing the thought processes initiated by the narrator's fear impulse.[11] The sequence, designed in part by Fincher, was
