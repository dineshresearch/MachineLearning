Shiva
Shiva (pronunciation: [ É…™. ã…ô]; Sanskrit: ‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ, ≈öiva, lit. "Auspicious one" ) is a major Hindu god and one aspect of Trimurti. In the Shaiva tradition of Hinduism, Shiva is seen as the supreme God. In the Smarta tradition, he is one of the five primary forms of God.[2][3]
Followers of Hinduism who focus their worship upon Shiva are called Shaivites or Shaivas (Sanskrit ≈öaiva).[4] Shaivism, along with Vai·π£·πáava traditions that focus on Vishnu and ≈öƒÅkta traditions that focus on the goddess Devƒ´ are three of the most influential denominations in Hinduism.[3]
Shiva is usually worshipped in the form of Shiva linga. In images, he is generally represented as immersed in deep meditation or dancing the Tandava upon Maya, the demon of ignorance in his manifestation of Nataraja, the lord of the dance.
In some other Hindu denominations, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva represent the three primary aspects of the divine in Hinduism and are collectively known as the Trimurti. In this school of religious thought, Brahma is the creator, Vishnu is the maintainer or preserver, and Shiva is the destroyer or transformer.[5]

The Sanskrit word Shiva (Devanagari: ‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ, ≈õiva) is an adjective meaning "auspicious, kind, gracious".[6][7] As a proper name it means "The Auspicious One", used as a euphemistic name for Rudra.[7] In simple English transliteration it is written either as Shiva or Siva. Pronunciation is written in the International Phonetic Alphabet as IPA:†[…ïiv…ô]. The adjective ≈õiva, meaning "auspicious", is used as an attributive epithet not particularly of Rudra, but of several other Vedic deities.[8] In the Rig Veda, Indra uses this word to describe himself several times. (2:20:3, 6:45:17, 8:93:3)
In Tamil, Shiva literally means "the supreme one". Adi Sankara, in his interpretation of the name Shiva, the 27th and 600th name of Vishnu sahasranama, interprets Shiva to mean either "The Pure One", "the One who is not affected by three Gunas of Prakrti, Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas" or "the One who purifies everyone by the very utterance of His name."[9] Swami Chinmayananda, in his translation of Vishnu sahasranama, further elaborates on that verse: Shiva means "the One who is eternally pure" or "the One who can never have any contamination of the imperfection of Rajas and Tamas".[10]
The Sanskrit word ≈õaiva means "relating to the god Shiva", and this term is the Sanskrit name both for one of the principal sects of Hinduism and for a member of that sect. [11] It is used as an adjective to characterize certain beliefs and practices, such as Shaivism.[12]
The name Shiva, in one interpretation, is also said to have derived from the Dravidian word Siva, meaning "to be red". It is the equivalent of Rudra, "the red".[13]
Siva's role as the primary deity of Shaivism is reflected in his epithets MahƒÅdeva ("great god"; mahƒÅ = great + deva = god),[14][15] Mahe≈õhvara ("great lord"; mahƒÅ = great + ƒ´≈õhvara = lord),[16][17] and Parame≈õhvara ("Supreme Lord").[18]
There are at least eight different versions of the Shiva Sahasranama, devotional hymns (stotras) listing many names of Shiva.[19] The version appearing in Book 13 (Anu≈õƒÅsanaparvan) of the Mahabharata is considered the kernel of this tradition.[20] Shiva also has Dasha-Sahasranamas (10,000 names) that are found in the Mahanyasa. The Shri Rudram Chamakam, also known as the ≈öatarudriya, is a devotional hymn to Shiva hailing him by many names.[21][22]

The worship of Shiva is a pan-Hindu tradition, practiced widely across all of India, Nepal and Sri Lanka.[23][24] Some historians believe that the figure of Shiva as we know him today was built up over time, with the ideas of many regional sects being amalgamated into a single figure.[25] How the persona of Shiva converged as a composite deity is not well documented.[26] Axel Michaels explains the composite nature of Shaivism as follows:
Like Vi≈ü≈Üu, ≈öiva is also a high god, who gives his name to a collection of theistic trends and sects: ≈öaivism. Like Vai≈ü≈Üavism, the term also implies a unity which cannot be clearly found either in religious practice or in philosophical and esoteric doctrine. Furthermore, practice and doctrine must be kept separate.[27]
An example of assimilation took place in Maharashtra, where a regional deity named Khandoba is a patron deity of farming and herding castes.[28] The foremost center of worship of Khandoba in Maharashtra is in Jejuri.[29] Khandoba has been assimilated both as a name for Karttikya[30] and also as a form of Shiva himself[31], in which case he is worshipped in the form of a lingam.[28][32] Khandoba's varied associations also include an identification with Surya.[28] The derivation of the name Khandoba has been variously interpreted, and M. S. Mate says that the most commonly held belief is that it was a distorted form of Skanda but also notes alternate theories.[33]

A seal discovered during the excavation of Mohenjo-daro has drawn attention as a possible representation of a "proto-Shiva" figure.[34] This Pashupati (Lord of animal-like beings)[35] seal shows a seated figure, possibly ithyphallic, surrounded by animals.[36] Sir John Marshall and others have claimed that this figure is a prototype of Shiva and have described the figure as having three faces seated in a "yoga posture" with the knees out and feet joined. However, this claim is not without its share of critics, with some academics like Gavin Flood[34][37] and John Keay[38] characterizing them as unfounded.

Shiva as we know him today shares many features with the Vedic god Rudra[39], and both Shiva and Rudra are viewed as the same personality in a number of Hindu traditions. Rudra, the god of the roaring storm, is usually portrayed in accordance with the element he represents as a fierce, destructive deity.
The oldest surviving text of Hinduism is the Rig Veda, which is dated to between 1700 and 1100 BCE based on linguistic and philological evidence.[40] A god named Rudra is mentioned in the Rig Veda. The name Rudra is still used as a name for Shiva. In RV 2.33, he is described as the "Father of the Maruts", a group of storm gods.[41] Furthermore, the Rudram, one of the most sacred hymns of Hinduism found both in the Rig and the Yajur Vedas and addressed to Rudra, invokes him as Shiva in several instances, but the term Shiva is used as a epithet for Indra, Mitra and Agni many times.
The identification of Shiva with the older god Rudra is not universally accepted, as Axel Michaels explains:
To what extent ≈öiva's origins are in fact to be sought in Rudra is extremely unclear. The tendency to consider ≈öiva an ancient god is based on this identification, even though the facts that justify such a far-reaching assumption are meager.[42]
Rudra is called "The Archer" (Sanskrit: ≈öarva)[43], and the arrow is an essential attribute of Rudra.[44] This name appears in the Shiva Sahasranama, and R. K. Sharma notes that it is used as a name of Shiva often in later languages.[45] The word is derived from the Sanskrit root ≈õarv-, which means "to injure" or "to kill"[46], and Sharma uses that general sense in his interpretive translation of the name ≈öarva as "One who can kill the forces of darkness".[45] The names Dhanvin ("Bowman")[47] and BƒÅ·πáahasta ("Archer", literally "Armed with arrows in his hands")[47][48] also refer to archery.

Shiva's rise to a major position in the pantheon was facilitated by his identification with a host of Vedic deities, including Agni, Indra, PrajƒÅpati, VƒÅyu, and others.[49]

Rudra and Agni have a close relationship.[50][51] The identification between Agni and Rudra in the Vedic literature was an important factor in the process of Rudra's gradual development into the later character as Rudra-Shiva.[52] The identification of Agni with Rudra is explicitly noted in the Nirukta, an important early text on etymology, which says, "Agni is called Rudra also."[53] The interconnections between the two deities are complex, and according to Stella Kramrisch:
The fire myth of Rudra-≈öiva plays on the whole gamut of fire, valuing all its potentialities and phases, from conflagration to illumination.[54]
In the ≈öatarudrƒ´a, some epithets of Rudra, such as Sasipa√±jara ("Of golden red hue as of flame") and Tiva·π£ƒ´mati ("Flaming bright"), suggest a fusing of the two deities.[55] Agni is said to be a bull[56], and Lord Shiva possesses a bull as his vehicle, Nandi. The horns of Agni, who is sometimes characterized as a bull, are mentioned.[57][58] In medieval sculpture, both Agni and the form of Shiva known as Bhairava have flaming hair as a special feature.[59]

The Indologist Koenraad Elst proposes that Shiva of Puranic Hinduism is a continuation of the Vedic Indra.[citation needed] He gives several reasons for his hypothesis. Both Shiva and Indra are known for having a thirst for Soma. Both are associated with mountains, rivers, male fertility, fierceness, fearlessness, warfare, transgression of established mores, the Aum sound, and the Supreme Self. In the Rig Veda, the term ≈õiva is used to refer to Indra. (2.20.3,[60] 6.45.17,[61][62] and 8.93.3 [63])
Indra, like Shiva, is likened to a bull.[64][65] In the Rig Veda, Rudra is the father of the Maruts, but he is never associated with their warlike exploits as is Indra.[66] In the present form of Hinduism, Indra and Shiva are considered as distinct deities.[citation needed]
