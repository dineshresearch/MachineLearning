Grace O'Malley
Gr√°inne N√≠ Mh√°ille (c. 1530 ‚Äì c. 1603), also known as Granuaile or Gr√°inne Mhaol, known in English as Grace O'Malley (sometimes "O'Mealey", another Anglicism), is an important figure in Irish folklore, but was in fact a larger-than-life real person from 16th century Irish history. O'Malley is sometimes known as "The Sea Queen Of Connaught". Her name appears in contemporary documents as Gr√°inne Ui Mh√°ille, Gr√°inne Umhaill. Anglicized versions of her name in contemporary English state papers included Grany O'Maly, Grany Imallye, Granny Nye Male, Grany O'Mayle, Granie ny Maille, Granny ni Maille, Grany O'Mally, Grayn Ny Mayle, Grane ne Male, Grainy O'Maly, and Granee O'Maillie.[1] She has been biographed primarily in the 20th and 21st century by the historian Anne Chambers. The Irish song "Or√≥ S√© do Bheatha 'Bhaile" is dedicated to her. Her story is currently being made into a feature film.

Gr√°inne N√≠ Mh√°ille was born in Ireland around 1530, when Henry VIII was on the throne of England. Under the policies of the English government at the time, the semi-autonomous Irish princes and lords were left mostly to their own devices. However this was to change over the course of her life and the Tudor re-conquest of Ireland gathered pace.
She was the daughter of Eoghan Dubhdara √ì M√°ille,[2] chieftain of the √ì M√°ille clan. The √ì M√°illes controlled most of what is now the barony of Murrisk[2] in South-West County Mayo and recognized as their nominal overlords the Gaelicized Anglo-Norman Burke or de Burgo family who controlled much of what is now that county. Her mother, Margaret, was also a N√≠ Mh√°ille. Although she was the only child of Dubhdara and his wife, Gr√°inne N√≠ Mh√°ille had a half-brother, called D√≥nal na Piopa (Donal of the Pipes), who was the son of her father.[3]
Unusual among the Irish nobility of the time, the √ì M√°illes were a seafaring family and taxed all those who fished off their coasts, which included fishermen from as far away as England. Their leader bore the ancient Irish title of "An √ì M√°ille" ("The O'Malley", or "The O'Mealey" - as the name is also anglicised).
According to Irish legend, as a young girl N√≠ Mh√°ille wished to go on a trading expedition to Spain with her father, and on being told she could not because her long hair would catch in the ship's ropes, she cut off most of her hair to embarrass her father into taking her, thus earning her the nickname "Gr√°inne Mhaol" (IPA:†[Ààgr…ëÀên ≤…ô veÀêl]) (Irish maol meaning "bald" or having cropped hair); the name stuck.
As a child she most likely lived at her family's residence of Belclare and Clare Island,[1] but she may have been fostered to another family since fosterage was traditional among Irish nobility at the time.
N√≠ Mh√°ille was probably formally educated, since she is believed to have spoken in Latin with Queen Elizabeth I at their historic meeting in 1593.[4] Because of her extensive travels and trade, she may have spoken some English, Spanish, Scottish Gaelic, and French as well.

N√≠ Mh√°ille was married in 1546 at the young age of 16 to D√≥nal an-Chogaidh (Donal of the Battle) O'Flaherty, t√°naiste or heir to the O'Flaherty title, which would have been a good political match for the daughter of the O'Mh√°ille chieftain. As O'Flaherty t√°naiste, D√≥nal an-Chogaidh one day expected to rule Iar Connacht, the area roughly equivalent to modern Conamara.[5]
She bore three children during her marriage to D√≥nal an-Chogaidh O'Flaherty:
Later the warlike D√≥nal was killed in battle, and N√≠ Mh√°ille recaptured a castle from the Joyces that had been his (now Hen's Castle in Lough Corrib). She afterwards returned to Mayo and took up residence at the family castle or tower-house on Clare Island.
After D√≥nal's death, Gr√°inne left Iar-Connacht and returned to O'Mh√°ille territory, taking with her many O'Flaherty followers who were loyal to her.[7]

By 1566 N√≠ Mh√°ille had married a second time, this time to Richard-an-Iarainn Burke (also Bourke), called "Iron Richard",[8] an appropriate corruption of his Irish name as he is reputed to have always worn a coat of mail inherited from his Anglo-Norman ancestors. The nickname may also have come from the fact that he controlled the ironworks at Burrishoole, where his principal castle and residence were.[9]
Traditionally it is said that the Burke marriage was motivated by N√≠ Mh√°ille's desire to enlarge her holdings and her prestige. Burke was owner of Rockfleet Castle, also called Carraigahowley Castle, which was strategically situated near Newport, as well as other lands like Burrishoole, with sheltered harbors in which a pirate ship could hide. Burke held a high position as chieftain of a senior branch of his sept.[10] Because of his sept leadership he would eventually be eligible for election as MacWilliam, the second most powerful office in Connacht.[11]
According to tradition they married under Brehon law 'for one year certain', and it is said that when the year was up Gr√°inne divorced Burke and kept the castle. Legend says that when the one year had passed, N√≠ Mh√°ille and her followers locked themselves in Rockfleet Castle and Gr√°inne called out a window to Burke, "Richard Burke, I dismiss you." Those words had the effect of ending the marriage, but since she was in possession of the castle she kept it.[12] Rockfleet remained for centuries in the O'Mh√°ille family and is today open to the public.
Despite the divorce story, N√≠ Mh√°ille and Burke appear as mentioned as husband and wife in English documents of the period, so appeared to remain married, at least allied, as far as the English were concerned. In her answers to the interrogatories from Queen Elizabeth I, N√≠ Mh√°ille said she was Richard Burke's widow.
They had one son, Tibbot Burke, nicknamed Tiob√≥id na Long (Tibbot of the Ships), who was born about 1567.[13] Tibbot was later knighted as Sir Theobald Bourke, and was created first Viscount Mayo in 1626 by Charles I. Burke had at least four other children, Edmund, Walter, John, and Catherine.[14]

N√≠ Mh√°ille was accused of promiscuity, and it was said that she may have had a son out of wedlock. Biographer Anne Chambers points out that despite hints at these facts in certain state documents, allegations such as these were frequently made against women who acted in a manner contrary to the social norms of the day.[15]
The Chambers biography relates that the legendary reason for N√≠ Mh√°ille's seizure of Doona Castle in Ballycroy was because the MacMahons, who owned the castle, killed her lover, Hugh de Lacy, the shipwrecked son of a Wexford merchant N√≠ Mh√°ille had rescued.[16]

Even as a young woman Gr√°inne N√≠ Mh√°ille was involved in the business of sailing ships and international trade.[17] She probably learned the business from her father, Eoghan "Dubhdara" √ì M√°ille, who plied a busy international shipping trade. Bunowen Castle, where she lived with her first husband, D√≥nal an-Chogaidh O'Flaherty, was situated on the most western point in Connacht, and was apparently the first base for her shipping and trade activities. By the time of Donal's death in the early 1560s, she commanded the loyalty of so many O'Flaherty men that many of them left the area when she did, and followed her to Clare Island in Clew Bay, where she moved her headquarters.[18]
D√≥nal an-Chogaidh O'Flaherty had taken a fortress in the Lough Corrib from the Joyce clan. Because of Donal's attitude, the Joyces bagan calling that particular fortress "Cock's Castle." When they heard of his death, they decided to take back the castle. Grainne defended it against them successfully, and apparently the Joyces were so impressed with her abilities in battle that they renamed it Caislean an-Circa, the "Hen's Castle," the name by which it is still known. The English later attacked her at the Hen's Castle, but despite being outnumbered O'Malley withstood the siege. According to legend, she took lead from the roof of the fortress and melted it, then poured it onto the heads of the attacking soldiers. She summoned help by sending a man to light a beacon on the nearby Hill of Doon. Some time before she had ordered the signal beacons set up for just such a purpose. Help arrived and the English were beaten back, never to attack the fortress again.[19]
Around the time of her first husband's death came the initial complaints to the English Council in Dublin from Galway's city leaders that O'Flaherty and N√≠ Mh√°ille ships were behaving like pirates. Because Galway imposed taxes on the ships that traded their goods there, the O'Flahertys, led by N√≠ Mh√°ille, decided to extract a similar tax from ships traveling in waters off their lands. N√≠ Mh√°ille's ships would stop and board the traders and demand either cash or a portion of the cargo in exchange for safe passage the rest of the way to Galway. Resistance was met with violence and even murder. Once they obtained their toll, the O'Flaherty ships would disappear into one of the many bays in the area.[20][21]
By the early 1560s, N√≠ Mh√°ille had left O'Flaherty territory and returned to her father's holdings on Clare Island.[22] She recruited fighting men from both Ireland and Scotland, transporting the gallowglass mercenaries between their Scottish homes and Irish employers and plundering Scotland's outlying islands on her return trips.[23] In an apparent effort to curry favor with the English, which were engaged in a re-conquest of Ireland at the time, N√≠ Mh√°ille went to the Lord Deputy of Ireland and offered two hundred fighting men to serve English interests in Ireland and Scotland.[23]
N√≠ Mh√°ille's attacked other ships at least as far away as Waterford on the south central coast of Ireland, as well as closer to her home port in northwestern Ireland. She did not limit her attacks to other ships. She attacked fortresses on the shoreline, including Curradh Castle at Renvyle and the O'Loughlin castle in the Burren. She also attacked the O'Boyle and MacSweeney clans in their holdings in Burtonport, Killybegs and Lough Swilly.[24]
In 1577, she met with Sir Henry Sidney, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, who already knew of her since she had met his son, Sir Philip Sidney, in 1576. Although Philip Sidney would have been a very young man at the time, N√≠ Mh√°ille evidently made an impression on him since he mentioned her in favorable terms to his father.[4]
N√≠ Mh√°ille was wealthy on land as well as by sea. She inherited her father's fleet of ships and land holdings, as well as the land her mother had owned. Around the time of her meeting with Queen Elizabeth I of England, she owned herds of cattle and horses that numbered at least one thousand, which would have meant she was wealthy.[24]

Many folk stories and legends about N√≠ Mh√°ille have survived since her actual days of pirating and trading. There are also traditional songs and poems about her.
A widespread legend concerns an incident at Howth, which apparently occurred in 1576. During a trip from Dublin, N√≠ Mh√°ille attempted to pay a courtesy visit to Howth Castle, home of the 8th Baron Howth. However, she was informed that the family was at dinner and the castle gates were closed against her. In retaliation, she abducted the Earl's son and heir, the 10th Baron. He was eventually released when a promise was given to keep the gates open to unexpected visitors, and to set an extra place at every meal. Lord Howth gave N√≠ Mh√°ille a ring as pledge on the agreement. The ring remains in the possession of a descendant of Gr√°inne N√≠ Mh√°ille, and at Howth Castle today, this agreement is still honoured by the Gaisford St. Lawrence family, descendants of the Baron.[25]
The legendary reason for N√≠ Mh√°ille's seizure of Doona Castle in Ballycroy was because the MacMahons, who owned the castle, killed her lover, Hugh de Lacy, the shipwrecked son of a Wexford merchant N√≠ Mh√°ille had rescued. When the guilty members of the MacMahon clan landed on the holy island of Caher for a pilgrimage, N√≠ Mh√°ille captured their boats. She and her men then captured the MacMahons and killed those responsible for her lover's death. Still not satisfied with her revenge, N√≠ Mh√°ille then sailed for Ballycroy and attacked the garrison at Doona Castle, overpowering the defenders and taking the castle for herself.[16]
Her attack against the MacMahons was not the first time she interrupted someone at their prayers. Legend tells of another chieftain who stole property from N√≠ Mh√°ille and fled to a church for sanctuary. N√≠ Mh√°ille was determined to wait out the thief, maintaining that he could starve or surrender. The thief dug a tunnel and escaped, however, and the hermit who took care of the church broke his vow of silence to scold her for attempting to harm someone who had sought sanctuary. Gr√°inne's reply is not included in the legend.[26]

In 1593, in his letter to protesting Gr√°inne N√≠ Mh√°ille's claims against him, Richard Bingham claimed that N√≠ Mh√°ille was "nurse to all rebellions in the province for this forty years".[23][27] Bingham was Lord President of Connacht, with the task of increasing control over the local lords that had been effectively self-governing.
N√≠ Mh√°ille had every reason, and used every opportunity, to limit the power of the Kingdom of Ireland over her part of the country. Her castle at Clare Island was attacked by an expedition from Galway intended to get rid of her.[when?] However, they were put to flight and barely escaped. Later N√≠ Mh√°ille was captured, but released some time afterward.

In the later 16th century English power steadily increased in Ireland and Gr√°inne's power was steadily encroached upon. Finally, in 1593, when her sons, Tibbot Burke and Murrough O'Flaherty, and her half-brother, Donal-na-Piopa, were taken captive by the English governor of Connaught, Sir Richard Bingham, N√≠ Mh√°ille sailed to England to petition Elizabeth I for their release. Elizabeth apparently took to N√≠ Mh√°ille, who was three years older, and the two women reached sufficient agreement for Elizabeth to grant N√≠ Mh√°ille's requests provided that her support of many Irish rebellions and piracy against England ended. Their discussion was carried out in Latin, as N√≠ Mh√°ille spoke no English and Elizabeth spoke no Irish.
Elizabeth I famously sent N√≠ Mh√°ille a list of questions, which she answered and returned to Elizabeth. N√≠ Mh√°ille then came to England (as previously stated) to petition the release of her sons and half-brother. She met with Elizabeth at Greenwich Palace, wearing a fine gown, the two of them surrounded by guards and the members of Elizabeth's royal Court. N√≠ Mh√°ille refused to bow before Elizabeth because she did not recognize her as the Queen of Ireland, and wished to show Elizabeth this. It is also rumored that N√≠ Mh√°ille had a dagger concealed about her person, which guards found upon searching her. Elizabeth's courtiers were said to be very upset and worried, but N√≠ Mh√°ille informed the queen that she carried it for her own safety. Elizabeth accepted this and, though the dagger was removed from N√≠ Mh√°ille's possession, did not seem to worry. Some also reported that N√≠ Mh√°ille sneezed and was given a lace-edged handkerchief from a noblewoman. She apparently blew her nose into the handkerchief and then threw the piece of cloth into a nearby fireplace, much to the shock of the court. N√≠ Mh√°ille amusedly informed Elizabeth and her court that, in Ireland, a used handkerchief was considered dirty and was destroyed.
N√≠ Mh√°ille and Elizabeth, after much talk, agreed to a list of demands. For example, Elizabeth was to remove Richard Bingham from his position in Ireland, and Gr√°inne was to stop supporting the Irish Lords' rebellions. N√≠ Mh√°ille sailed back to Ireland, and the meeting seemed to have done some good, for Richard Bingham was removed from service. However, several of N√≠ Mh√°ille's other demands (i.e. the return of the cattle and land that Bingham had stolen from her, for instance) remained unmet, and within a rather short period of time, Elizabeth sent Bingham back to Ireland. Upon Bingham's return, N√≠ Mh√°ille realized that the meeting with Elizabeth had been useless, and went back to supporting Irish rebellions.

Despite the meeting, N√≠ Mh√°ille later returned to her old ways, though nominally directing her raids against the "enemies of England" during the Nine Years War. She most likely died at Rockfleet Castle in 1603, the same year as Elizabeth, though the year and place of her death are disputed.
More than 20 years after her death, an English lord deputy of Ireland recalled her ability as a leader of fighting men, noting her fame and favor that still existed among the Irish people.[28][29]

Westport House in County Mayo, Ireland, is home to the 11th Marquess of Sligo and his family. They are direct descendants of Granuaile / Grace O'Malley.
Grace O‚ÄôMalley had several castles in the West of Ireland and it was on the foundations of one of these that Westport House, was actually built. There is still an area of her original castle in the basement of the House (the Dungeons), which is on view to visitors.
The original House was built by Colonel John Browne, a Jacobite, who was at the Siege of Limerick, and his wife Maude Bourke. Maude Bourke was Grace O‚Äô Malley‚Äôs great-great granddaughter.
There is a Bronze statue of Grace O‚ÄôMalley by the artist Michael Cooper - the Marquess of Sligo's brother-in-law - situated on the grounds of Westport House.[30]
Westport House also conatins a comprehensive exhibition on the life of Grace O'Malley compiled by author Anne Chambers, the World's leading authority on Granuaile.

Gr√°inne's life has inspired musicians, novelists and playwrights to create works based on her adventures.
Perhaps the best known is the concert piece "Granuaile" (1985) by Irish composer Shaun Davey.
The latest artistic project is the musical play The Pirate Queen by Alain Boublil, Claude-Michel Sch√∂nberg, Richard Maltby, Jr. and John Dempsey, which originally debuted at Chicago's Cadillac Palace Theatre in October 2006, with American stage actor Stephanie J. Block as Grania (Gr√°inne). The Pirate Queen is based on Morgan Llywelyn's 1986 novel about O'Malley's life, Grania: She-King of the Irish Seas. Morgan Llewellyn's book, in turn, takes from Anne Chambers' biography, who was credited as consultant. The musical moved to Broadway in March 2007, but closed in June due to lack of interest on the part of theatre-goers and less-than-stellar reviews.
James Joyce used the legend of Gr√°inne N√≠ Mh√°ille ("her grace o'malice") and the Earl of Howth in chapter 1 of Finnegans Wake, but added the kidnapping of another fictional son, Hilary, to match his Shem and Shaun theme. Christopher/Tristopher is turned into a Luderman (happy Lutheran) and Hilary into a Tristian (sad Christian).
The play Bald Grace by Marki Shalloe debuted at Chicago's Stockyards Theatre in 2005 and was featured at Atlanta's Theatre Gael (American's oldest Irish-American theatre) in 2006.[31] A musical drama written in 1989, Grannia, story and lyrics by Thomas A. Power and music by Larry Allen, also tells the story of N√≠ Mh√°ille from childhood to her meeting with Elizabeth I. It won the 1990 Moss Hart Award.
Romance author Bertrice Small portrays N√≠ Mh√°ille in several of her books, particularly in Skye O'Malley, where
