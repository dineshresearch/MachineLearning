South Park
South Park is an American animated sitcom, notorious for its crude, surreal, and often very dark humor, which satirizes a wide range of topics including religion, politics, violence, abuse, sexuality, and mental illness.[2] Trey Parker and Matt Stone created the show and continue to do most of the writing, directing, and voice acting.
The narrative revolves around four children â€” Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick â€” and their bizarre experiences in the titular mountain town. The show has won acclaim and a plethora of awards, including three Primetime Emmys for Outstanding Animated Program.
Comedy Central has aired a total of 186 episodes since the show's debut in 1997. Doug Herzog, who brought South Park to the network, credits the show's strong ratings in its early years for putting Comedy Central "on the map".[3] The thirteenth season premiered in March 2009. Parker and Stone are under contract to produce 14 new episodes a year through 2011.[3]
Two feature-length movies have also been released; the musical film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut had a widespread theatrical run in 1999, and the three-episode Imaginationland story arc was reissued straight-to-DVD in 2008.[4]

The show revolves around the adventures of four boys â€” Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick (often called "the boys" when as a group for easier reference) â€” and their friends living in the fictional small town of South Park, Colorado. The boys were in the third grade but midway through season four they entered the fourth grade where they have stayed ever since.[5][6] There are many recurring characters on the show, including the boys' families, school staff, and other students. These include Leopold "Butters" Stotch, Chef (who no longer appears in the show), Mr. Hankey, Towelie, Jesus, and Satan. There are also many other minor characters.
South Park's early episodes tended to be shock value-oriented and featured more slapstick-style humor than later episodes. Although satire had been used on the show occasionally earlier on, it became more prevalent in later episodes. Episodes have parodied Michael Jackson ("The Jeffersons"), Paris Hilton ("Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset"), and The Passion of the Christ ("The Passion of the Jew"). The show has also addressed serious political issues such as terrorism ("Cartoon Wars"), American immigration policy ("Goobacks"), gay marriage ("Follow That Egg!"), racism ("With Apologies to Jesse Jackson"), and the Terri Schiavo case ("Best Friends Forever").
Controversies over South Park have occurred numerous times. The show depicts what many people find to be taboo subject matter, from its use of vulgarity ("It Hits the Fan") to its satire of subjects such as religion and cults (such as "All About the Mormons?", "Bloody Mary", "Red Hot Catholic Love", "Fantastic Easter Special", and "Trapped in the Closet"), sexuality ("The Death Camp of Tolerance"), drugs ("My Future Self n' Me", "Up the Down Steroid"), and global warming ("Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow"). Stone and Parker are self-described "equal opportunity offenders" and episodes often lampoon all sides of a contentious issue, rather than taking a concrete position. Usually, the boys and/or other characters ponder over what has transpired during an episode and convey the important lesson taken from it with a speech commonly beginning with the phrase "You know what? I've learned something today...".


South Park began in 1992 when Trey Parker and Matt Stone, at the time students at the University of Colorado, met in a film class and created an animated short called Jesus vs. Frosty.[7] The low-budget crudely made film featured prototypes of the main characters of South Park, including a character resembling Cartman but named "Kenny", an unnamed character resembling what is today Kenny, and two near-identical unnamed characters who would resemble Stan and Kyle.
FOX executive Brian Graden saw the film and in 1995 commissioned Parker and Stone to create a second short film that he could send to his friends as a video Christmas card. Titled Jesus vs. Santa, it resembled the style of the later series more closely, and featured a martial arts duel and subsequent truce between Jesus and Santa Claus over the true meaning of Christmas.[8] This video was later featured in the episode "A Very Crappy Christmas" in which Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and Mr. Hankey "save" Christmas for the town. The video was popular and was widely shared, both by duplication and over the Internet. This led to talks to create a series, first with FOX, then with Comedy Central, where the series debuted on August 13, 1997.

Unlike most animated shows, which take months to be written and produced, episodes of South Park are usually created in less than a week. New episodes air on Wednesdays, so production begins the previous Thursday and takes the entire team 100â€“120 hours each to complete in the ensuing week.[9] Almost all work on the series is done in-house at South Park Studios in Culver City, Los Angeles.[3][10]
Thanks to this efficient method, the creators are able to respond quickly to current events. The December 17, 2003 episode "It's Christmas in Canada" depicted the capture of Saddam Hussein a mere three days after the actual event, even referring to the "spider hole" in which he was found.[11] In this instance â€” as with the EliÃ¡n GonzÃ¡lez episode ("Quintuplets 2000") â€” the creators changed the production of an episode at the last minute to focus on the new world event. The Season 12 episode "About Last Night..." aired just 23 hours after Barack Obama was declared the winner in the 2008 presidential election. The episode uses excerpts from the speeches given by Obama and John McCain the night before, and also refers to the celebration that ensued following Obama's victory.
Stan Marsh and Kyle Broflovski were initially designed to represent creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone respectively; however, both have admitted to ultimately identifying far more with Cartman.[citation needed] The town of South Park is inspired by both real-life towns in the South Park basin such as Fairplay and the Denver suburbs such as Littleton, the sites of the respective upbringings of South Park co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone.[12]

The show's style of animation was inspired by the paper cut-out cartoons made by Terry Gilliam for Monty Python's Flying Circus, of which Trey Parker and Matt Stone have been lifelong fans.[13] Construction paper and traditional stop motion cutout animation techniques were used in the original animated shorts and in the pilot episode made for Comedy Central. The pilot episode required three months to produce. Subsequent episodes have been produced by computer animation providing a similar look to the originals while requiring a fraction of the time to produce. Episodes of South Park are usually completed in four or five days.[14]
Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator (and previously CorelDRAW) are used to design new characters and objects, which are then imported into and animated using Maya (PowerAnimator was used prior to the fifth season).[10][15] The use of PowerAnimator and Maya is an interesting choice as they are mainly used for 3D computer graphics; Parker and Stone compared it to "building a sandcastle with a bulldozer."[16] However, according to Director of Animation Eric Stough, PowerAnimator was chosen because it "has the best shadow and ray casting, so it looks like construction paper sitting on a camera stand."[10] Several other techniques are used to achieve the "amateur" look. Objects are moved across the screen manually and a "stepped" curve is applied to every second frame giving motion an "organic jumpy look".[17][18] The show is also animated at 24 frames per second and transferred to 30 frame/s video using the 3:2 pulldown process.[18]
PowerAnimator was also used for special effects such as the disco lights in the episode "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride" and the laser beams in "Mecha-Streisand".[10] Nowadays, the team uses Motion for special effects.[9] In the beginning, animation was done on SGI workstations linked to a 54-processor render farm that could render 10 to 15 shots an hour.[9] For a short time, Windows computers were used.[9] When Maya was released for Mac, production shifted to Mac workstations. The studio now runs a 120-processor render farm that can produce 30 or more shots an hour.[9]
The appearance of characters and scenes has become less crude over time, largely in order to enhance the comedic effect. Special effects, such as prepackaged explosions, have replaced cardboard-style fires. Light shading has been used to highlight "sappy", movie-like moments as well as some of Cartman's dramatic poses. Some episodes, such as "Tweek vs. Craig" and "Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina", have even incorporated sections of live-action video. A few episodes use an entirely different style of animation, for example, portions of "Good Times with Weapons" was done in anime style, while "Make Love, Not Warcraft" was done partly in machinima.[19]

Matt Stone and Trey Parker voice most of the male South Park characters,[20] while April Stewart and Mona Marshall (formerly Mary Kay Bergman and Eliza Schneider) voice most of the female characters such as Wendy Testaburger and Sheila Broflovski. Other voices are currently provided by Adrien Beard (Token Black),[21] Vernon Chatman (Towelie),[20] and Jennifer Howell (Bebe Stevens).[20] Former members of the voice cast include Isaac Hayes (Chef) and John Hansen (Mr. Slave).[22][23] Hayes, a Scientologist, left after a falling out with the creators over their treatment of Scientology in the episode "Trapped in the Closet".[24]
Celebrities that appear on the show are usually impersonated, however, some celebrities lend their voice to their characters. Celebrities who have voiced themselves include Jay Leno, and the bands Radiohead and Korn. Celebrities who have lent their voices to other characters include Jennifer Aniston,[25] George Clooney,[26] Cheech & Chong, Henry Winkler, Natasha Henstridge, and Peter Serafinowicz.
The voices are often edited with Pro Tools.[27]

The show's original theme song was a musical score performed by the band Primus and sung by the band's lead singer Les Claypool. The original composition was originally slower but was sped up for the show.[28] An instrumental version of the original theme song is still often played during the show's closing credits.[28] The opening theme song has been remixed three times during the course of the series (as of season ten), and certain lines have been altered. Starting from the episode "4th Grade", a hip hop version of the theme song remixed by Paul Robb was used. From season six onwards, the theme song changed to an even faster version with a more country music influence. Halfway through season 10 the title music was once again remixed to sample the song "Whamola", performed by The Les Claypool Frog Brigade, from the album Purple Onion.[29]
Additional musical contributions to the show formerly came from Isaac Hayes, who voiced Chef's singing of usually sexual songs to explain certain adult themes to the boys. The Chef song "Chocolate Salty Balls" was released as a single in the UK in 1998 to support the Chef Aid album and became a number one hit.[30] Many episodes also feature highly melodramatic musical scores to comically exaggerate the emotional content of the scene. For example, melancholy music plays in the background when Timmy sends away his beloved pet turkey, Gobbles, in the episode "Helen Keller! The Musical". In the show, Eric Cartman will often burst into song to convey a false altruism or optimism that belies his baser motivations. In "Red Sleigh Down", he sings "Poo-Choo Train", an unnervingly cheery
