List of webcomics
This list of notable webcomics includes comics which are (or were) primarily published on the World Wide Web, known as webcomics. It is organized chronologically by the comics' start dates.
The dates shown after a name relate to the period during which the comic began appearing and, in the case of defunct comics, finished appearing. There is usually a fair degree of accuracy about the starting date, particularly in the case of comics whose archives are organized by date, but because of sporadic updates or the gradual loss of appeal of a particular strip the termination date is often uncertain. A double-dot (..) appearing instead of a termination date indicates the comic is still current as of this writing.
The names shown refer to the primary creators of each webcomic.
