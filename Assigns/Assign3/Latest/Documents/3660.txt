List of countries by population
This is a list of countries ordered according to population. The list includes sovereign states and inhabited dependent territories.
Areas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities, such as the European Union,[1] that have some degree of sovereignty but do not consider themselves to be sovereign states, and dependent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as various countries' claims to Antarctica.[2] The estimated total population of the world is 6,771,600,000.[3]
Sovereign states are listed in bold text and dependent territories in italic. States listed that do not have general recognition are in bold and italic.
