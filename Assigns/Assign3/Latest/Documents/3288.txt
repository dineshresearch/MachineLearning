Chuck (TV series)
Chuck is an action-comedy television program from the United States created by Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak. The series is about an "average computer-whiz-next-door" who receives an encoded e-mail from an old college friend now working in the CIA; the message embeds the only remaining copy of the world's greatest spy secrets into Chuck's brain.[1][2]
Produced by College Hill Pictures, Wonderland Sound and Vision and Warner Bros. Television, the series premiered on September 24, 2007, on NBC, airing on Monday nights at 8PM/7c leading into Heroes.[3][4] On November 26, NBC announced that Chuck received a full season pickup.[5] On February 13, 2008, it was announced by NBC that Chuck had been picked up for a second season in 2008/2009.[6] The second season started on September 29, 2008, with a full 22-episode season order.[7] NBC released the first episode of season two a week before its air date via multiple online distribution methods, and cable on demand.

Chuck Bartowski (Zachary Levi) is a socially awkward twenty-something in Burbank, CA who works as a computer expert at the Nerd Herd at his local Buy More (a parody of Best Buy's Geek Squad),[8] a large retail consumer-electronics chain, with his best friend, Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez). Chuck's sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) is a doctor who is constantly looking out for his best interests and wants to help him find a girlfriend. Also joining the cast is Ellie's fiance, Devon "Captain Awesome" Woodcomb (Ryan McPartlin), also a doctor looking out for Chuck's social life. On the night of his birthday party, Chuck receives an e-mail from his former Stanford University roommate, Bryce Larkin (Matthew Bomer), who is now a "rogue" CIA agent. When he opens it, the entire database of all the US government's secret information â€” a neural supercomputer called The Intersect â€” is subliminally embedded into his brain. Both the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency want the intelligence returned to them and dispatch agents of their own â€” Major John Casey (Adam Baldwin) and Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski) â€” to retrieve the data.
Since the disk with the government information was stolen by Bryce and destroyed in his attempted escape, and since Chuck experiences "flashes" of information from the database activated by certain triggers around him (such as faces, guns, watches, and other objects), he must use the knowledge he now possesses to help the government thwart assassins and international terrorists â€” upending his previously uneventful life. In order to preserve their safety, Chuck must keep his new-found occupation a secret from his family and friends, forcing Casey and Walker to establish an uneasy alliance and secret identities; Walker poses as Chuck's girlfriend and takes a cover job at the local restaurant next to the Buy More (formerly Wienerlicious, currently Orange Orange) while Casey gets a job at the Buy More, with the shared goal of protecting Chuck at all costs.
In the meantime, the government is in the process of rebuilding the Intersect computer. As it nears completion, Casey is ordered to kill Chuck as soon as the new Intersect is ready. However, in the premiere of season 2, it is destroyed using a computer virus, keeping Chuck alive. As the series progresses, it is revealed that Bryce is still alive and that a rival agency called "Fulcrum" is in search of the Intersect, which they believed to still be in the possession of Bryce, not Chuck. It is also discovered that Fulcrum are the ones who destroyed the new Intersect. In the episode "Chuck vs. Santa Claus" (season 2, episode 11, aired 12/15/08), a Fulcrum agent known as Mauser discovers that it is Chuck, in fact, who is the Intersect. This discovery, however, does not last long, as Sarah kills Agent Mauser before he is able to notify anyone else in Fulcrum. (This sparks a subplot in the following episode involving Chuck coming to terms with the shooting.)
In the episode "Chuck vs. The Suburbs" (2/16/09), the implant of all Fulcrum secrets that Fulcrum had developed was implanted into Chuck's head.




Josh Schwartz and newcomer Chris Fedak wrote the script for the first episode which was initially given a put pilot commitment by NBC before a pilot order was green lit by the network in January 2007.[9] Schwartz and Fedak both attended the University of Southern California and the latter pitched the idea to Schwartz who agreed to develop the project with him.[10] Joseph McGinty Nichol, Schwartz's fellow executive producer on The O.C., directed the first hour of the series and consequently became an executive producer via his production company, Wonderland Sound and Vision. Fedak, Peter Johnson, Scott Rosenbaum, Matthew Miller and Allison Adler also serve as co-executive producers.[11] NBC gave the series an early pick-up and a thirteen-episode order on May 10, 2007.[12] On November 26, 2007, TV Guide reported that NBC had picked up the series for a full, 22 episode season.[13]

Zachary Levi and Adam Baldwin were the first two to be cast in February 2007 in the roles of Chuck Bartowski and veteran NSA agent Major John Casey, respectively. Fedak always had Baldwin in mind for the role of John Casey and the producers found that the actor was a "perfect fit" for the character during the first casting session.[10][14] Relative newcomer Yvonne Strahovski, an Australian, was chosen for the female lead role of CIA officer Sarah Walker in the same month.[15] Casting continued throughout March with Sarah Lancaster, Joshua Gomez, and Natalie Martinez landing the parts of Dr. Ellie Bartowski (Chuck's older sister), Morgan Pace (Chuck's best friend), and Kayla Hart (Chuck's neighbor and love interest), respectively.[16] The Kayla Hart character was dropped before filming because creators Chris Fedak and Josh Schwartz found it unlikely and too complicated to the storyline that two women would be pining over Chuck. Morgan's surname was later changed to "Grimes" and Sarah's surname was changed to "Walker" as it was previously "Kent".[citation needed]

The first showing of the pilot occurred on July 27, 2007 at Comic-Con International in San Diego.[17] The series was originally slated to air on Tuesday nights at 9PM/8c as announced at the 2007 Upfronts but this was later changed to Monday nights at 8PM/7c as announced during the 2007 Television Critics Association summer press tour. The season premiere aired on September 24, 2007 on NBC.[4][18] The pilot was leaked onto torrent websites on July 22, 2007.[19] All thirteen episodes produced before the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike have aired. The last two episodes of the original thirteen aired on January 24, 2008, with episode 12 airing at 8PM/7c and episode 13 at 10PM/9c, three days after they aired in Canada. Season Two premiered on September 29, 2008. While the series originally had a 13 episode order, NBC went ahead and ordered another nine, ensuring the series will get the full 22-episode treatment.[7] The theme song is Short Skirt/Long Jacket by Cake.
