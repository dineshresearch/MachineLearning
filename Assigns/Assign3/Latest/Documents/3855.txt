Alpha Centauri (Œ± Centauri / Œ± Cen); (also known as Rigil Kentaurus, Rigil Kent, or Toliman) is the brightest star in the southern constellation of Centaurus and an established binary star system, Alpha Centauri AB (Œ± Cen AB). To the unaided eye it appears as a single star, whose total visual magnitude identifies it as the third brightest star in the night sky.
Alpha Centauri is the closest star system to the Solar System, being only 1.34 parsecs, or 4.37 light years away from our Sun.[9]

"Alpha Centauri" ("Rigil Kentaurus") is the name given to what appears as a single star to the naked eye, the brightest star in the southern constellation of Centaurus. With the aid of a telescope, Alpha Centauri can be resolved into a binary star system in close orbit. This is known as "Alpha Centauri AB" system, often abbreviated as "Œ± Centauri†AB" or "Œ±†Cen†AB".
"Alpha Centauri†A (Œ±†Cen A)" and "Alpha Centauri B (Œ±†Cen†B)" are the individual stars of the binary system, usually defined to identify them as the different component of the binary Œ±†Cen†AB. As viewed from Earth, there is an additional companion located 2.18¬∞ away from the AB star system, a distance much greater than the observed separation between stars A and B. This companion is called "Proxima Centauri", "Proxima" or "Œ±†Cen†C". If it were bright enough to be seen without a telescope, Proxima Centauri would appear to the naked eye as a star separate from Œ±†Cen†AB. Alpha Centauri AB and Proxima Centauri form a visual double star, which is assumed to be gravitationally associated with Œ± Cen AB system. Direct evidence that it has an elliptical orbit typical of binary stars is yet to be found.[10]
Together all three components make a triple star system, referred by double star observers as the triple star (or multiple star), "Œ±†Cen†AB-C".
This naming system allows specialist double star astronomers to define system components and the relationships between the different components. All component designations are held and controlled by the U.S. Naval Observatory, in a continuously updated catalogue called the Washington Double Star Catalogue or WDS. It contains over 102,387 double stars or pairs using this system of designation.[10]

At ‚àí0.27v visual magnitude,[11] Alpha Centauri appears to the naked-eye as a single star and is fainter than Sirius and Canopus. The next brightest star in the night sky is Arcturus. When considered among the individual brightest stars in the sky (excluding the Sun), Alpha Centauri A is the fourth brightest at +0.01 magnitude,[12] being only fractionally fainter than Arcturus at -0.04v magnitude. Alpha Centauri B at 1.33v magnitude is twenty-first in brightness.
Alpha Centauri A is the principal member or primary of the binary system, being slightly larger and more luminous than our Sun. It is a solar-like main sequence star with a similar yellowish-white colour, whose stellar classification is spectral type G2 V.[12] From the determined mutual orbital parameters, Œ± Cen A is about 10% more massive than our Sun, with a radius about 23% larger.[5] The projected rotational velocity (†v¬∑sin†i†) of this star is 2.7¬±0.7†km¬∑s-1, resulting in an estimated rotational period of 22†days.[7]
Alpha Centauri B is the companion star or secondary, slightly smaller and less luminous than our Sun. This main sequence star is of spectral type of K1 V,[4][12] making it more an orangish-yellow color than the whiter primary star. Œ± Cen B is about 90% the mass of the Sun and 14% smaller in radius.[5] The projected rotational velocity (†v¬∑sin†i†) is 1.1¬±0.8†km¬∑s-1, resulting in an estimated rotational period of 41†days.[7] (An earlier estimate gave a similar rotation period of 36.8†days.)[13] Although it has a lower luminosity than component A, star B's spectrum emits higher energies in X-rays. The light curve of B varies on a short time scale and there has been at least one observed flare.[14]
Alpha Centauri C, also known as Proxima Centauri, is of spectral class M5Ve[12] or M5VIe, suggesting this is either a small main sequence star (Type V) or sub-dwarf (VI) with emission lines, whose B-V colour index is +1.81. Its mass is about 0.12 M ò.
Together, the bright visible components of the binary star system are called Alpha Centauri AB (Œ± Cen AB). This "AB" designation denotes the apparent gravitational centre of the main binary system relative to other companion star(s) in any multiple star system.[15] "AB-C" refers to the orbit of Proxima around the central binary, being the distance between the centre of gravity and the outlying companion. Some older references use the confusing and now discontinued designation of A√óB. Since the distance between the Sun and Œ± Cen AB does not differ significantly from either star, gravitationally this binary system is considered as if it were one object.[16]

Resolution of the binary star Œ± Cen AB is too close to be seen by the naked eye, as the angular separation varies between 2 and 22†arcsec,[17] but through much of the orbit, both are easily resolved in binoculars or small 5†cm telescopes.[18]
In the southern hemisphere, Alpha Centauri is one of the stars of The Pointers or The Southern Pointers [18] with Beta Centauri or Hadar / Agena. [19] Both stars directly point towards the constellation Crux‚Äîthe Southern Cross.[18] The Pointers easily distinguish the true Southern Cross from the fainter asterism known as the False Cross.[20] Beta Centauri lies some 4.5¬∞ west, mid-way between the Crux and Œ± Centauri.[18]
South of about -29¬∞ S latitude, Œ± Centauri is circumpolar and never sets below the horizon.[21] Both stars, including the Crux, are too far south to be visible for mid-latitude northern observers. Below about +29¬∞ N latitude to the equator during the northern summer, Œ± Centauri lies close to the southern horizon.[19] The star culminates each year at midnight on 24 April or 9 p.m. on 8 June.[19][22]
As seen from Earth, Proxima Centauri lies 2.2¬∞ southwest from Alpha Centauri AB.[23] This is about four times the angular diameter of the Full Moon, and almost exactly half the distance between Œ± and Œ≤ Centauri. Proxima usually appears as a deep-red star of 13.1v visual magnitude in a poorly populated star field, requiring moderately sized telescopes to see. Listed as V645 Cen in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars (G.C.V.S.) Version 4.2, this UV Ceti-type flare star can unexpectedly brighten rapidly to about 11.0v or 11.09V magnitude.[12] Some amateur and professional astronomers regularly monitor for outbursts using either optical or radio telescopes.[24]

According to the renowned double star observer Robert Aitken (1961), Father Richaud discovered Alpha Centauri AB‚Äôs duplicity from the Indian city of Pondicherry in December 1689 while observing a comet.[25][26] By 1752, Abb√© Nicolas Louis de Lacaill√© made astrometric positional measurements using a meridian circle while Sir John Herschel, in 1834, made the first micrometrical observations.[27] Since the early 20th Century, measures have been made with photographic plates.[28]
By 1926, William Stephen Finsen calculated the approximate orbit elements close to those now accepted for this system.[29] All future positions are now sufficiently accurate for visual observers to determine the relative places of the stars from a binary star ephemeris.[30] Others, like the French astronomer D. Pourbaix (2002), have regularly refined the precision of any new published orbital elements.[26]
Popularly known, Alpha Centauri is the closest star system to our Solar System. It lies about 4.37 light-years in distance, or about 41.5 trillion kilometres, 25.8 trillion miles or 277,600 AU. Astronomer Thomas James Henderson made the original discovery from many exacting observations of the trigonometric parallaxes of the AB system between April 1832 and May 1833. He withheld the results because he suspected they were too large to be true, but eventually published in 1839 after Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel released his own accurately determined parallax for 61 Cygni in 1838.[31] For this reason, we consider Alpha Centauri as the second star to have its distance measured.
R.T.A. Innes from South Africa in 1915 discovered Proxima Centauri by blinking photographic plates taken at different times during a dedicated proper motion survey. This showed the large proper motion and parallax of the star was similar in both size and direction to those of Œ± Centauri AB, suggesting immediately it was part of the system and slightly closer to us than Œ± Centauri AB. Lying 4.22 light-years away, Proxima Centauri is the nearest star to the Sun. All current derived distances for the three stars are presently from the parallaxes obtained from the Hipparcos star catalog (HIP).[32][33][34][35]

With the orbital period of 79.91†years[26], the A and B components of this binary star can approach each other to 11.2 astronomical units (equivalent to 1.67 billion km or about the mean distance between the Sun and Saturn), or recede as far as 35.6†AU (5.3 billion km‚Äîapproximately the distance from the Sun to Pluto).[26][36] This is a consequence of the binary's substantial orbital eccentricity e†=†0.5179,‚Äî unlike the planetary orbits in the Solar System, whose orbital eccentricities do not exceed e†=†0.1 (with the exception of Mercury with e†=†0.206).[26] From the orbital elements, the total mass of both stars is about 2.0†M‚òâ[37] - or twice that of the Sun.[36] The average individual stellar masses are 1.09†M‚òâ and 0.90†M‚òâ, respectively,[38] though quoted in recent years are some slightly higher mass values, such as 1.14†M‚òâ and 0.92†M‚òâ[12], or totalling 2.06†M‚òâ. Alpha Centauri A and B have absolute magnitudes of +4.38 and +4.71, respectively.[12][28] Stellar evolution theory implies both stars are slightly older than the Sun[5] at 5 to 6 billion years, as derived by both mass and their spectral characteristics.[23][39]
Viewed from Earth, the apparent orbit of this binary star means that the separation and position angle (P.A.) are in continuous change throughout the projected orbit. Observed stellar positions in 2008 are separated by 8.29†arcsec through a P.A. of 237¬∞, reducing to 7.53†arcsec through 241¬∞ in 2009.[26] Next closest approach will be in February 2016, at 4.0†arcsec through 300¬∞.[26] (See
