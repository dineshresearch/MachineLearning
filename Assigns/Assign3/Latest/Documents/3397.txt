Nutella
Nutella is the brand name of a hazelnut-based sweet spread registered by the Italian company Ferrero at the end of 1963. The recipe was developed from an earlier Ferrero's spread released in 1949. Nutella is now marketed in over 75 countries across the globe. It has become a large sensation among the chocolate-loving crowd, with its own World Nutella Day.

Gianduja is a type of chocolate containing about 50% almond and hazelnut paste that was developed in Piedmont, Italy after excessive taxes on cocoa beans hindered the diffusion of conventional chocolate. Pietro Ferrero owned a patisserie in Alba, in the Langhe district of Piedmont, an area known for the production of hazelnuts. In 1946 he sold an initial batch of 300†kilograms (660†lb) of "Pasta Gianduja". This was a solid block, but in 1949 Pietro developed his first spread, which he first sold in 1951 as "Supercrema".
In 1963, Pietro's son Michele Ferrero decided to revamp Supercrema, with the intention of marketing it Europe-wide; its composition was modified, as well as the label image and brand name: the name "Nutella" (based on the word "nut") and its logo were registered towards the end of the same year, and remain unchanged to this day. The first jar of Nutella left the Ferrero factory in Alba on April 20, 1964. The product was an instant success, and remains widely popular. The estimated Italian production of Nutella averages 179,000 tons per year.[citation needed]

The Italian pronunciation is IPA:†[nuÀàt…õlÀêa], and an approximation of this is made in most other languages, including American English. In the UK, however, Nutella is normally pronounced /n åÀàt…õl…ô/, reflecting its derivation from the English word "nut" /n åt/.

Nutella is a modified form of gianduja. The exact recipe is a secret closely guarded by Ferrero. According to the product label, the main ingredients of Nutella are sugar and modified vegetable oils, followed far behind by hazelnut, cocoa and skimmed milk, comprising together at most 28% of the ingredients. The recipe for Nutella varies in different countries. In the case of Italy the formulation uses less sugar than the product sold in France. Nutella is marketed as "hazelnut cream" in many countries; it cannot be labeled as a chocolate cream under Italian law, as it does not meet minimum cocoa concentration criteria.
About half of the calories in Nutella come from fat (11g in a 37g serving, or 99 kcal out of 200 kcal) and about 40% of the calories come from sugar (20g, 80 kcal).[1]

Nutella is generally not recommended for people with an allergy to nuts.
For many years (according to the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, from at least October 2000 to at least August 2007) the Nutella USA FAQ used to state that the peanut oil used in Nutella production goes through a hot-solvent extraction process, which removes its protein content and is thus supposed to make it non-allergenic. This FAQ statement has been removed. The fact that Nutella contains traces of peanuts has caused it to be banned (in common with other foods that may contain nuts) from school lunches in some schools in Australia, UK, and Canada where pupils bring their own lunch to school. These schools call themselves "Nut-free zones".[2] As of late 2007, Nutella sold in the USA and Canada no longer uses peanut oil.
Nutella is also not recommended for people with milk allergy or lactose intolerance because of its skimmed milk and whey content.

Although Nutella is marketed in a variety of packages, its typical containers have always been those made of glass (plastic containers are more common in the USA, Mexico and Greece[citation needed]). Initially, the most popular glass containers were quite small, in fact just the size of a standard table glass for drinking, with the result that they can be used as normal table glasses once the product inside has been consumed. Different forms of these glasses are produced, turning them into collectible items.
Nowadays, Nutella is more frequently marketed in jars of a characteristic, trademarked oval shape (pictured above). These are often 200†g, 350†g, 400†g or 750†g jars, although in some countries (such as Italy and France), 3†kg and 5†kg jars are available (most often in special occasions, such as Christmas). One-dose 30g plastic packages are also available, usually sold in groups of three. In the United States it is typically sold in 13 oz jars (371 grams). Beside these, there are also 'limited editions' jars, like in the German market in 2002 to celebrate the introduction of the euro currency. The jar contained 1.95583 kg which is the exact exchange rate Deutsche Mark - Euro.
In Australia, Nutella is sold in the standard shape plastic jars with translucent plastic screw top lids. Single serve catering packs aimed at the school lunch market are also available in retail stores.


In its home country of Italy, Nutella has become a cultural and social phenomenon. Many books have been written about it, and it is the core of a celebrated scene in the movie Bianca, by the Italian filmmaker Nanni Moretti, in which a character relieves his post-coital anxieties by eating chocolate coated bread, spread from a gigantic Nutella jar.

In France, Nutella is the most popular spread. It represents 89% of the market share. Ferrero's factory in Villers-√âcalles is the world largest producer of Nutella with about 70,000 tons per year.

Nutella is also very popular in the rest of Europe, India, Malaysia, Puerto Rico, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Brazil, Trinidad and Tobago, Mexico, the Philippines and South Africa, mostly with children and teenagers. This is less true in the United States and Canada, where the product was only available as an expensive import until the 2000s. In the United States, basketball star Kobe Bryant was a former spokesman for Nutella, having grown up in Italy. Nutella is briefly mentioned in Chlo√© Doutre-Roussel's "The Chocolate Connoisseur", which includes an anecdote of her mother flying into Mexico with several jars and smearing it on her face to convince a Customs Officer that it was a facial mask, and not a banned food product. In 1999 Nutella was one of the official sponsors of the 1999/2000 UEFA Champions league season. They were advertised at every game on a bill board.

While Nutella has generally become synonymous with hazelnut and chocolate spread worldwide, similar products with other brand names enjoy wide success in some countries. This includes "Merenda" in Greece ("merenda" is Italian for a mid-afternoon snack), Nocilla in Spain, Nucita in South America.
