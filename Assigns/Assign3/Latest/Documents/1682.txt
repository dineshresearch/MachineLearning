Cryptid
Cryptid is a term which is used in the pseudoscience of cryptozoology to refer to a creature whose existence has been suggested but lacks scientific support.[1] This includes purported organisms such as Bigfoot, Yeti, and the Loch Ness Monster, as well as extinct species claimed by cryptozoologists to be living today, such as dinosaurs.

The term was coined by John E. Wall in a 1983 letter to the International Society of Cryptozoology newsletter.[2]
Evidence for the existence of cryptids is typically limited to anecdotal evidence or other forms of evidence insufficient to withstand normal scientific scrutiny by the general zoological community.
The existence of several cryptids has been debunked through scientific investigation by cryptozoologists, zoologists, and other interested parties.[citation needed] Some allegations have been exposed as deliberate hoaxes (for example, The Surgeon's Photograph).[citation needed] Still, cryptozoology is a subject that has made its way into popular culture and often intrigues media consumers,[citation needed] as illustrated by shows like Monster Quest, Destination Truth and The Secret Saturdays.

The term 'cryptid' has also been applied by cryptozoologists to animals whose existence is accepted by the scientific community, but which are considered of interest to cryptozoology, such as the coelacanth, once believed to be extinct, and the okapi, at one time thought to be entirely fictitious.
Legendary creatures such as the unicorn and the dragon are sometimes described as cryptids, but many cryptozoologists avoid describing them as such.[3]
