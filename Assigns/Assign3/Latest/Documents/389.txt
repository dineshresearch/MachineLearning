BPM 37093
BPM 37093 is a variable white dwarf star of the DAV, or ZZ Ceti, type, with a hydrogen atmosphere and an unusually high mass of approximately 1.1 times the Sun's. It is about 50 light-years from Earth, in the constellation Centaurus, and vibrates; these pulsations cause its luminosity to vary.[4][1] Like other white dwarfs, BPM 37093 is thought to be composed primarily of carbon and oxygen, which are created by thermonuclear fusion of helium nuclei in the triple-alpha process.[6]
In the 1960s, it was predicted that as a white dwarf cools, its material should crystallize, starting at the center.[7] When a star pulsates, observing its pulsations gives information about its structure. BPM 37093 was first observed to be a pulsating variable in 1992[8], and in 1995 it was pointed out that this yielded a potential test of the crystallization theory.[9] In 2004, Travis Metcalfe and a team of researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics estimated, on the basis of these asteroseismological observations, that approximately 90% of the mass of BPM 37093 had crystallized.[7][10][11][4] Other work gives a crystallized mass fraction of between 32% and 82%.[5] Any of these estimates would result in a total crystalline mass in excess of 5Ã—1029 kilograms.
Crystallization of the material of a white dwarf of this type is thought to result in a body-centered cubic lattice of carbon and/or oxygen nuclei, which are surrounded by a Fermi sea of electrons.[12] Since a diamond also consists of crystallized carbon, the star BPM 37093 has been nicknamed Lucy after The Beatles's hit Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.[10]
