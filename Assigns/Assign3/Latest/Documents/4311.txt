Waldorf education (also known as Steiner or Steiner-Waldorf education) is a pedagogy based upon the educational philosophy of Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy. Learning is interdisciplinary, integrates practical, artistic, and conceptual elements,[1] and is coordinated with "natural rhythms of everyday life".[2] The Waldorf approach emphasizes the role of the imagination in learning,[3][4][5] developing thinking that includes a creative as well as an analytic component.[6][7] Studies of the education describe its overarching goal as providing young people the basis on which to develop into free, moral[8][9] and integrated individuals,[10][11][3] and to help every child fulfill his or her unique destiny (the existence of which anthroposophy posits).[2][12] Schools and teachers are given considerable freedom to define curricula within collegial structures.[13]
The first Waldorf school was founded in 1919; there are now about 1000[14][15] independent Waldorf schools and 1400 independent Waldorf kindergartens[16] located in approximately sixty countries throughout the world, making up one of the world's largest independent educational systems; there are also Waldorf-based public and Charter schools, homeschooling environments,[3] and schools for special education. Waldorf methods have also been adopted by numerous educators teaching in other schools, both state and private.[17][18][19]

The structure of the education follows Steiner's pedagogical model of child development,[20] which describes three broad developmental stages of childhood, each having its own learning requirements;[21] the stages are similar to those described by Piaget.[22]
The theory of child development underlying Waldorf education is founded upon the Anthroposophical view of the human being. The approach has been termed "the most complete articulation of an evolutionary developmental K-12 curriculum and creative teaching methodology".[26]

Waldorf schools approach learning in early childhood through imitation and example.[27][28] Extensive time is given for guided free play in a classroom environment that is homelike, includes natural materials and provides examples of productive work in which children can take part;[21] such an environment is considered by Waldorf pedagogues to be supportive of the physical, emotional and intellectual growth of the child through assimilative learning.[28] Outdoor play periods are also generally incorporated into the school day, with the intention of providing children with experiences of nature, weather and the seasons of the year. In Waldorf schools oral language development is addressed through songs, poems and movement games. These include daily story time when a teacher usually tells a fairytale, often by heart.[22] Aids to development via play include the Waldorf doll, a style of doll made intentionally simple in order to allow the child playing with it to strengthen their imagination and creativity. Waldorf kindergartens and lower grades discourage exposure to media influences such as television, computers and recorded music, as they believe these to be harmful to cognitive development in the early years.[23][29]
The education emphasizes early experiences of daily and annual rhythms, including seasonal festivals drawn from a variety of traditions. Though Waldorf schools in the Western Hemisphere have traditionally celebrated Michaelmas and Martinmas in the autumn, Christmas in winter, Easter and May Day in the spring, and St. John's Day in summer,[30] Western schools are now incorporating an increasingly wide range of cultural and religious traditions,[31] and schools located where Jewish, Buddhist, or Islamic traditions are dominant celebrate festivals drawn from these cultures.

In Waldorf schools elementary education may begin when the child is nearing or already seven years of age.[32] The elementary school centers around a multi-disciplinary arts-based curriculum that includes visual arts, drama, artistic movement (eurythmy), vocal and instrumental music, and crafts.[24][33] Throughout the elementary years, students learn two foreign languages (in English-speaking countries often German and either Spanish or French).
Throughout the elementary years, concepts are first introduced through stories and images, and academic instruction is integrated with the visual and plastic arts, music and movement.[34] There is little reliance on standardized textbooks;[35] instead, each child creates his or her own illustrated summary of coursework in book form.[36] The school day generally starts with a one-and-a-half to two-hour academic lesson that focuses on a single theme over the course of about a month's time[7] and generally begins with an introduction that may include singing, instrumental music, recitations of poetry, including a verse written by Steiner for the start of a school day,[30] and practice in mathematics and language arts.
An objective of most Waldorf schools is to have a single teacher loop with a class throughout the elementary school years, teaching at least the principal academic lessons;[7] Waldorf teachers have been cited for their level of personal commitment to their pupils.[37]
Waldorf teachers use the concept of the four temperaments to help interpret, understand and relate to the behaviour and personalities of children under their tutelage. The temperaments, choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine,[35] are thought to express four basic personality types, each possessing its own fundamental way of regarding and interacting with the world.
Waldorf elementary education allows for individual variations in the pace of learning, based upon the expectation that a child will grasp a concept or achieve a skill when he or she is ready.[12] Cooperation takes priority over competition.[37][2] This approach also extends to physical education; competitive team sports are introduced in upper grades.[23]

In most Waldorf schools, pupils enter secondary education when they are about fourteen years old. The education is now wholly carried out by specialist teachers. The education now focuses much more strongly on academic subjects,[38] though students normally continue to take courses in art, music, and crafts. Pupils are encouraged to develop their own independent and creative thinking processes.[38] The curriculum is structured to help students develop a sense of competence, responsibility and purpose,[6] to foster an understanding of ethical principles, and to build a sense of social responsibility.[21]

There are widely-agreed guidelines for the Waldorf curriculum,[39][40][41] supported by the schools' common principles;[33] nevertheless, independent Waldorf schools are autonomous institutions not required to follow a prescribed curriculum. Government-funded Waldorf-method schools may be required to incorporate aspects of state curricula.
There are a few subjects largely unique to the Waldorf schools. Foremost among these is Eurythmy, a movement art usually accompanying spoken texts or music which includes elements of role play and dance and is designed to provide individuals and classes with a "sense of integration and harmony".[2]
Waldorf schools generally introduce computers into the curriculum in the teenage years.[42]

Rudolf Steiner wrote his first book on education, The Education of the Child, in 1907. The first school based upon these principles was opened in 1919 in response to a request by Emil Molt, the owner and managing director of the Waldorf-Astoria Cigarette Company in Stuttgart, Germany. This is the source of the name Waldorf, which is now trademarked for use in association with the educational method. The Stuttgart school grew rapidly, opening parallel classes, and by 1938 schools inspired by the original school or its pedagogical principles had been founded in the USA, UK, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Hungary, and in other towns in Germany. Political interference from the Nazi regime limited and ultimately closed most Waldorf schools in Europe; the affected schools, including the original school, were reopened after the Second World War.[43] As of May 2008, there are 965 independent Waldorf Schools worldwide.[15]
Waldorf schools have traditionally been numerically and culturally centered in Europe; the number of non-European schools has been slowly increasing, however, leading to a trend toward reinterpreting the formerly Euro-centric curriculum.[44]

One of Waldorf education's central premises is that all schools (not only Waldorf schools) should be both self-governing and grant teachers a high degree of creative autonomy within the school.[34][20][45] Most Waldorf schools are not directed by a principal or head teacher, but rather by a number of groups, including:
Parents are encouraged to take an active part in non-curricular aspects of school life.[2] Waldorf schools have been found to create effective adult learning communities.[46]
There are coordinating bodies for Waldorf education at both the national (e.g. the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America and the Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship in the UK and Ireland) and international level (e.g. International Association for Waldorf Education and The European Council for Steiner Waldorf Education (ECSWE)). These organizations certify the use of the registered names "Waldorf" and "Steiner school" and offer accreditations, often in conjunction with regional independent school associations.[47] Some Waldorf schools are independently accredited by governmental authorities.[48]

Waldorf schools seek to cultivate pupils' sense of social responsibility,[49] respect, and compassion; to develop their cooperative capacities; and to enable them to contribute to societal and cultural renewal.[50] The educational philosophy has been commended for being based upon peace and tolerance.[51]

Waldorf schools have linked polarized communities in a variety of settings.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, known as UNESCO, states that the Waldorf movement's "ideals and ethical principles...correspond to those of UNESCO,"[16] and has chosen a number of UNESCO Waldorf schools in Germany, Africa and Asia[58] to be associated project schools.
UNESCO also sponsored an exhibit about the Waldorf schools[30] at the 44th Session of their International Conference on Education in Geneva. An exhibition catalogue was published by UNESCO under the title Waldorf Education Exhibition Catalog On Occasion of the 4th Session of the International Conference on Education of UNESCO in Geneva.[59]
