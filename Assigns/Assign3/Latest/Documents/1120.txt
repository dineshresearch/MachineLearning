S. Darko
S. Darko: A Donnie Darko Tale[1] is an upcoming 2009 sequel to Donnie Darko. It is directed by Chris Fisher. S. Darko follows Samantha Darko, the younger sister of Donnie, the protagonist of Donnie Darko, and her friend Corey. On their way to Los Angeles, their car breaks down, forcing them to wait in a small town until it is fixed. While there, Samantha begins to have dreams that warn her of the end of the universe.
S. Darko is set to be released straight to video on DVD and Blu-ray May 12, 2009.[2]

Samantha Darko (Daveigh Chase) and her rebellious best friend Corey Richardson (Briana Evigan) leave on a cross-country road trip to Los Angeles in an attempt to 'make it big'. Their dreams are cut short when their water pump blows outside of a tiny Utah town. Unable to leave until their car is fixed, Sam and Corey are stranded with the locals. Sam and Corey are less than thrilled at the delay, and when an unexplained meteorite crash-lands in town that night, it soon becomes clear that there is much more at play than just a chance breakdown.
Plagued by bizarre hallucinatory dreams warning her of the universe's imminent end, as well as grief over her own loss of family, Sam must face the demons she had fled back at home. Aided by the unlikely town locals, Sam learns the true meaning of family and friendship, and tries to save what really matters.


Donnie Darko's writer and director, Richard Kelly, did not reprise his role as the director or writer of S. Darko. He stated "To set the record straight, here's a few facts I'd like to share with you all -- I haven't read this script. I have absolutely no involvement with this production, nor will I ever be involved." [3] Chris Fisher, director of S. Darko, noted that he was an admirer of Kelly's film, and that he hoped "to create a similar world of blurred fantasy and reality."[4]
Filming for S. Darko began on May 18, 2008.[4]
