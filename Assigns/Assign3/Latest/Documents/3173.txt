Capital punishment in the United States
Capital punishment in the United States varies by jurisdiction and is applied rarely, in practice only for aggravated murder and even more rarely for felony murder or contract killing.[1] The history of U.S. capital punishment begins in the colonies under the laws of their mother countries and was carried over into United States law and the law of most of the U.S. states and territories. The methods of execution and the crimes subject to the penalty vary by jurisdiction and have varied widely throughout time. Some jurisdictions have banned it, others have suspended its use, but others are trying to expand its applicability. There were 37 executions in 2008.[2] That is the lowest number since 1994[3] (essentially because of lethal injection moratoriums), but it may increase in 2009.[4][5]
Capital punishment is a controversial issue, with many prominent organizations and individuals participating in the debate. Arguments for and against capital punishment are based on moral, practical, religious, and emotional grounds. Advocates of the death penalty argue that it deters crime, is a good tool for prosecutors (in plea bargaining for example),[6] improves the community by making sure that convicted criminals do not offend again, provides closure to surviving victims or loved ones, is a just penalty for their crime and that no prison has been able to prevent murderers from killing again. Opponents argue that the death penalty does not deter and that capital punishment cheapens human life and puts government who take guilty lives on the same low moral level as criminals who have taken innocent life.[7]
Another argument (specific to the United States) on the capital punishment debate is the cost. The price of prosecution is more expensive if the jury issues a death sentence than if it issues life without parole.[8] But others who contest this argument says the greater cost of trials where the prosecution does seek the death penalty is offset, at least in part, by the savings from avoiding trial altogether in cases where the defendant pleads guilty.[9]
In 2007, New Jersey became the first state to repeal the death penalty in the modern system of capital punishment,[10] and New Mexico followed in 2009.[11] But in states with a large death row population and regular executions, including California and Texas, the death penalty remains strongly in the landscape and is unlikely to end at any time soon.

Capital punishment has been illegal in the U.S. state of Michigan since 1846, making Michigan's death penalty history unusual in contrast to many other states. Michigan was the first English-speaking government in the world to abolish the death penalty for all crimes except treason.[17][18] [19] On March 18, 2009, Governor Bill Richardson signed legislation, effective July 1, to make New Mexico the 15th state to ban the death penalty.[20]
The Espy file[21] lists 15,269 people executed in the United States and its predecessors between 1608 and 1991. 4,661 executions occurred in the U.S. in the period from 1930 to 2002 with about two-thirds of the executions occurring in the first 20 years.[22] Additionally the United States Army executed 135 soldiers between 1916 and 1999.[23][24][25]
The largest single execution in United States history was the hanging of 38 Dakota people convicted of murder and rape in the Dakota War of 1862. They were executed simultaneously on December 26, 1862 in Mankato, Minnesota. A single blow from an axe cut the rope that held the large four-sided platform, and the prisoners (except for one whose rope had broken, and who consequently had to be restrung) fell to their deaths.[26] The second largest mass execution in United States history was also a hanging: the execution of 13 African American soldiers for their parts in the Houston Riot in 1917. Notably, both incidents involved ethnic minority defendants, and military tribunal judgments in time of war.

Notes:
Capital punishment was suspended in the United States from 1972 through 1976 primarily as a result of the Supreme Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972). In this case, the court found the imposition of the death penalty in a consolidated group of cases to be unconstitutional, on the grounds of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment to the United States Constitution.
In Furman, the United States Supreme Court considered a group of consolidated cases. The lead case involved an individual convicted under Georgia's death penalty statute, which featured a "unitary trial" procedure in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and, simultan
