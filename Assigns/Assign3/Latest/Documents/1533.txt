Trilby
A trilby hat (or simply trilby) is a soft felt men's hat with a narrow brim, a deeply indented crown, and a pinch at the front. Traditionally it was made from rabbit hair felt, but is now sometimes made from other materials, including tweed and wool. Trilbies are softer than Homburgs, and have a flexible brim instead of a curved one. Trilbies are similar to fedoras, which can be seen as an American version with a wider brim. The hat's name derives from a play based on George du Maurier's 1894 novel Trilby, and one was worn in the first London production of the stage adaptation.
They were widely worn from the late 1920s onwards, initially as a casual sporting hat, such as for wearing to horse races. By the end of World War II, it had largely supplanted other hats such as Homburgs and bowlers for wear with a suit or smart casual, although it never replaced flat caps. It continued to be commonly worn this way until hats stopped being everyday wear for men in about the 1960s. The hat has been associated with jazz, ska and soul musicians, as well as members of the rude boy, mod, skinhead and 2 Tone subcultures. The trilby is widely worn amongst Orthodox Jews, especially Rabbis and yeshiva students.
