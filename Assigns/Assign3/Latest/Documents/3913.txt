Cannabis (drug)
C. sativa L. subsp. sativa
C. sativa L. subsp. indica
Cannabis, also known as marijuana[1] or marihuana,[2] or ganja (from Hindi/Sanskrit: ‡§ó‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ú‡§æ ga√±jƒÅ, hemp),[3] is a psychoactive drug extracted from the plant Cannabis sativa, or more often, Cannabis sativa subsp. indica. The herbal form of the drug consists of dried mature flowers and subtending leaves of pistillate (female) plants. The resinous form, known as hashish,[4] consists primarily of glandular trichomes collected from the same plant material. The major biologically active chemical compound in cannabis is Œî9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol), commonly referred to as THC.
Humans have been consuming cannabis since prehistory,[5] although in the 20th century there was a rise in its use for recreational, religious or spiritual, and medicinal purposes. It is estimated that about four percent of the world's adult population (162 million) use cannabis annually and 0.6 percent (22.5 million) daily.[6] The possession, use, or sale of psychoactive cannabis products became illegal in most parts of the world in the early 20th century. Since then, some countries have intensified the enforcement of cannabis prohibition while others have reduced the priority of enforcement.


Psychoactive potency by cannabis plant part is approximately as follows (descending order):[8]



For example, an ethanol extract of cannabis that has had the ethanol evaporated from it, to leave hash oil.

Because of THC's adhesive properties, resin builds up inside the paraphernalia when marijuana is smoked. It has tar-like properties but still contains THC as well as other cannibinoids. This resin still has all the psychoactive properties of marijuana but is harsher and less healthy on the lungs. Marijuana users typically only smoke resin as a last resort when they have run out of marijuana flowers.[11]

Cannabis is consumed in many different ways, most of which either involve inhaling smoke from ignited plant or administering orally.
Various devices exist for smoking cannabis. The most commonly used include screened bowls, bongs, chillums, paper-wrapped joints and cigar-leaf-wrapped blunts. Local methods differ by the preparation of the cannabis plant before use, the parts of the cannabis plant which are used, and the treatment of the smoke before inhalation.
The vaporizer heats herbal cannabis to 365‚Äì410†¬∞F (185‚Äì210†¬∞C), which causes the active ingredients to evaporate into a gas without burning the plant material (the boiling point of THC is 392†¬∞F (200¬∞C) at 0.02†mmHg pressure, and somewhat higher at standard atmospheric pressure),[12][13] A lower proportion of toxic chemicals are released than by smoking, although this may vary depending on the design of the vaporizer and the temperature at which it is set.
As an alternative to smoking, cannabis may be consumed orally. However, the cannabis or its extract must be sufficiently heated or dehydrated to cause decarboxylation of its most abundant cannabinoid, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, into psychoactive THC.[14]
Cannabis material can be leached in high-proof spirits (often grain alcohol) to create a tincture referred to as ‚ÄúGreen Dragon‚Äù. This process is often employed to make use of low-potency stems and leaves.[citation needed]
Cannabis can also be consumed as a cannabis tea. THC is lipophilic and only slightly water soluble (with a solubility of 2.8 mg per liter),[15] so tea is made by first dissolving the active components in a fat such as milk, cream, butter, which is mixed with hot water to make a tea.

Cannabis has psychoactive and physiological effects when consumed. The minimum amount of THC required to have a perceptible psychoactive effect is about 10†micrograms per kilogram of body weight.[16] The most common short-term physical and neurological effects include increased heart rate, lowered blood pressure, impairment of psychomotor coordination, concentration, and short-term memory.[citation needed] Long-term effects are less clear.

While many drugs clearly fall into the category of either stimulant, depressant, hallucinogen, or antipsychotic, cannabis, containing both THC and CBD, exhibits a mix of all properties, leaning towards hallucinogen properties due to THC being the primary constituent.[17][18][19]

Smoking of cannabis is the most harmful method of consumption, since the inhalation of smoke from organic materials such as cannabis, tobacco, wood and gasoline can cause various health problems.[20]
In comparison, study on cannabis vaporizing found that subjects were "only 40% as likely to report respiratory symptoms as users who do not vaporize, even when age, sex, cigarette use, and amount of cannabis consumed are controlled."[21] Another study found vaporizers to be "a safe and effective cannabinoid delivery system."[22][23]
A 2007 study by the Canadian government found cannabis smoke contained more toxic substances than tobacco smoke.[25] The study determined that marijuana smoke contained 20 times more ammonia, and five times more hydrogen cyanide and nitrogen oxides than tobacco smoke. In spite of this, recent studies have been unable to demonstrate a direct link between lung cancer and frequent direct inhalation of marijuana smoke. While many researchers have failed to find a correlation,[26][27] some researchers still conclude that marijuana smoke poses a higher risk of lung cancer than tobacco.[28] Some studies have even shown that the non-intoxicating ingredient CBD found in marijuana may be useful in treating breast cancer.[29]
Cannabis use has been assessed by several studies to be correlated with the development of anxiety, psychosis and depression,[30][31] however, no causal mechanism has been proven, and the meaning of the correlation and its direction is a subject of debate that has not been resolved in the scientific community. Some studies assess that the causality is more likely to involve a path from cannabis use to psychotic symptoms rather than a path from psychotic symptoms to cannabis use,[32] while others assess the opposite direction of the causality, or hold cannabis to only form parts of a "causal constellation", while not inflicting mental health problems that would not have occurred in the absence of the cannabis use.[33][34]
Studies have also shown links between heavy long-term use (over five joints daily over several years) and incidence of heart attacks, strokes, as well as abnormalities in the amygdala and hippocampus regions of the brain.[35][36]

Some claim that trying marijuana increases the probability that users will eventually use harder drugs. This hypothesis has been one of the central pillars of anti-cannabis drug policy in the United States,[37] though the validity and implications of these hypotheses are highly debated.[38] Studies have shown that tobacco smoking is a better predictor of concurrent illicit hard drug use than smoking cannabis.[39]
No widely accepted study has ever demonstrated a cause-and-effect relationship between the use of marijuana and the later use of harder drugs like heroin and cocaine. However, the prevalence of tobacco cigarette advertising and the practice of mixing tobacco and cannabis together in a single large joint, common in Europe, are believed to be a factor in promoting nicotine dependency among young persons investigating cannabis.[40]
A 2005 comprehensive review of the literature on the cannabis gateway hypothesis found that pre-existing traits may predispose users to addiction in general, the availability of multiple drugs in a given setting confounds predictive patterns in their usage, and drug sub-cultures are more influential than cannabis itself. The study called for further research on "social context, individual characteristics, and drug effects" to discover the actual relationships between cannabis and the use of other drugs.[41]
The main variant of the gateway hypothesis is that people, upon trying cannabis for the first time and not finding it dangerous, are then tempted to try other, harder drugs. In such a scenario, a new user of cannabis who feels there is a difference between anti-drug information and their own experiences will apply this distrust to public information about other, more powerful drugs.[citation needed] Some studies state that while there is no proof for this gateway theory, young cannabis users should still be considered as a risk group for intervention programs.[42] Other findings indicate that hard drug users are likely to be "poly-drug" users, and that interventions must address the use of multiple drugs instead of a single hard drug.[43]
Another gateway hypothesis is that while cannabis is not as harmful or addictive as other drugs, a gateway effect may be detected as a result of the "common factors" involved with using any illegal drug. Because of its illegal status, cannabis users are more likely to be in situations which allow them to become acquainted with people who use and sell other illegal drugs.[44][45] By this argument, some studies have shown that alcohol and tobacco may be regarded as gateway drugs.[39] However, a more parsimonious explanation could be that cannabis is simply more readily available (and at an earlier age) than illegal hard drugs, and alcohol/tobacco are in turn easier to obtain earlier than cannabis (though the reverse may be true in some areas), thus leading to the "gateway sequence" in those people who are most likely to experiment with any drug offered.[38]

Evidence of the inhalation of cannabis smoke can be found as far back as the 3rd millennium BC as indicated by charred cannabis seeds found in a ritual brazier at an ancient burial site in present day Romania.[5] The most famous users of cannabis were the ancient Hindus of India and Nepal. The herb was called ganjika in Sanskrit (‡§ó‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ú‡§æ/‡¶ó‡¶æ‡¶Å‡¶ú‡¶æ ganja in modern Indic languages).[47][48] The ancient drug soma, mentioned in the Vedas as a sacred intoxicating hallucinogen, was sometimes associated with cannabis.[49]
Cannabis was also known to the ancient Assyrians, who discovered its psychoactive properties through the Aryans.[50] Using it in some religious ceremonies, they called it qunubu (meaning "way to produce smoke"), a probable origin of the modern word 'Cannabis'.[51] Cannabis was also introduced by the Aryans to the Scythians and Thracians/Dacians, whose shamans (the kapnobatai‚Äî‚Äúthose who walk on smoke/clouds‚Äù) burned cannabis flowers to induce a state of trance.[52] Members of the cult of Dionysus, believed to have originated in Thrace (Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey), are also thought to have inhaled cannabis smoke. In 2003, a leather basket filled with cannabis leaf fragments and seeds was found next to a 2,500- to 2,800-year-old mummified shaman in the northwestern
