List of changes in Star Wars re-releases
The following are partial lists of changes in Star Wars re-releases. The commercial success of Star Wars has given George Lucas the opportunity to alter his original trilogy, which is composed of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, and Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. Many changes were motivated by George Lucas's desire to make the original films closer to his vision for them (although he directed only one of the films).
The new versions made heavy use of CGI technology and other new production techniques that emerged in the two decades after the original trilogy was produced. Other changes enhanced the cohesiveness of the films and eliminated continuity errors between the original trilogy and the three prequels (produced in the late 1990s and early 2000s). The changes are controversial, with opponents claiming that these changes detract from the character arc of the films and tend to be more distracting than expedient.
In a September 2004 CNN article, Lucas claimed that the original films were "25 to 30 percent" of what he intended. Despite this statement, the original films were massively popular and regarded as "groundbreaking", and many of his changes have met with lukewarm reception. Along with obvious changes to various scenes, the re-releases improved the visual and audio quality of the films.
Changes to Star Wars films after the theatrical release are not always limited to the original trilogy. In the release of The Phantom Menace DVD, two deleted portions were either partially or completely restored.
According to Lucasfilm, the 2004 Special Edition is the canonical version of the original trilogy, even though the original, unaltered theatrical editions were first released on DVD on September 12, 2006.

Here is a list of all re-releases.

These are pan and scan versions of the original theatrical releases of the original three films.
None of the original releases of Star Wars on VHS, Betamax, and RCA's CED contained the line uttered by C-3PO "The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave." This line was not in the original Dolby Stereo mix, which was the soundtrack used on all early video releases. In 1985 Ben Burtt re-mixed the soundtrack and the line was heard for the first time on home video.
Due to technical and cost limitations, the CED editions of Star Wars are presented time-compressed (sped up by 3%) from its original 121-minute length to 118 minutes to fit one double-sided two-hour disc.
In the UK and throughout Europe, widescreen VHS versions of the original three films were released in 1991. An advert before the films explained how widescreen showed more of the picture. They were re-released in 1994 with different artwork and released a third time as THX versions in 1995.
The VHS reissue in 1995, which was the last available release of the Preâ€“Special Edition trilogy prior to the 2006 DVD release, utilized THX digital remastering to enhance the picture and sound quality on all three films.

Due to technical limitations, most pan and scan versions of Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back are presented time-compressed (sped up by 3%) from their respective 121- and 125-minute lengths to fit one double-sided 2-hour disc. Letterbox versions of the original theatrical releases of the original three films have also been released.
The initial 1989 North American widescreen release of Star Wars suffered from a shrinking aspect ratio. The master that was used was the Japanese subtitled Laserdisc, in which the image appeared higher in the screen to allow for subtitles. For the North American release, it was shifted down, and a black bar was put up to cover the unused parts. However, as the film progresses, the image creeps up on the screen moving underneath the top bar, causing the image to become increasingly wide. By the time the film reaches the Battle of Yavin scenes, the image has widened from 2.35:1 to 2.55:1. This problem was fixed in the 1992 re-issue of the disc. The original shrinking LD has the CBS/Fox logo on it, but the fixed edition has the newer "Fox Video" logo on the jacket. The C-3PO line about the tractor beam can be heard on this laserdisc.
In 1993, the Star Wars Trilogy: The Definitive Collection box set was released. This version featured the original trilogy on 9 CAV discs, widescreen transfers, THX remastering, audio commentary tracks, assorted bonus features, a copy of the hardcover book George Lucas: The Creative Impulse, and for Star Wars IV: A New Hope, a new surround sound audio mix created from elements of the 70 mm 6 track magnetic, 35 mm Dolby Stereo optical and 35 mm optical mono mixes.[2]
Initial versions of this box set were missing approximately 10 seconds from The Empire Strikes Back. Fox Video offered a replacement disc, and this mistake was corrected in later pressings.[3]
The final Laserdisc edition of the original trilogy was released in 1995, sourced from the 1993 masters.[4]

In 1997, Episodes IV, V, and VI were re-mastered and theatrically re-released as the "Special Editions". For the re-release, in addition to extensive clean-up and restoration work, Lucas also made a number of changes to the films in order to "finish the film the way it was meant to be" (as Lucas claimed in a September 2004 interview with the Associated Press).
Many of Lucas's changes for the Special Editions were cosmetic, generally adding special effects which were not originally possible. Other changes, however, are considered to have affected plot or character development. These changes, such as the change referred to by fans as "Han shot first", have proven to be controversial.[5][6]

In 2004, in addition to an extremely extensive high-definition digital cleanup and restoration job by Lowry Digital Images, the original trilogy films were changed once again for their release on DVD on September 21, 2004. In these new versions of the films, a few changes which had been made for the 1997 Special Editions were removed and fresh changes were made to the films. With this release, Lucasfilm created a new high-definition master of the films, which will be used in future releases as well.
Two of the most notable of these new changes include new footage shot during the filming of Revenge of the Sith:
Although the vocals of Boba Fett were relatively minor to begin with, they were altered for the sake of consistency and continuity. The 2004 edition no longer has the original voice of Jason Wingreen but rather the voice of Temuera Morrison, as the prequel films fleshed out Boba as a clone of Jango Fett, portrayed by Morrison with his distinctive New Zealand accent.
In the DVD releases, the lightsaber blades were upgraded to look more like they do in the prequel trilogy, but they are still not quite near their quality. This is most evident in A New Hope, during Luke's training on the Falcon and Obi-Wan's fight with Vader.

In 2005, the 2004 Special Editions were again released on DVD; however, this time they were repackaged and sold as a three-disc set that did not include the bonus materials disc. This was done to provide a more affordable trilogy set. Labeled only as the "Star Wars Trilogy: Episode IV, V, VI" this set was also billed as a "Limited Edition". As of 2007, copies could still be found on many store shelves.

On September 12, 2006, the original trilogy was re-released on DVD for a limited time (until December 31, 2006), though, as of April 2009, copies can still be found in stores. Each film (Episodes IV, V, and VI) is packaged as a two-disc set with the first disc presenting the 2004 Special Edition with remastered THX sound and video and the second disc containing the "original, unaltered theatrical release" of each film as bonus material.
These original editions are said to be presented as they were first shown theatrically. For example, Star Wars has the 1977 opening crawl (before "Episode IV: A New Hope" was added and other adjustments made for the April 10, 1981 re-issue). However, the video transfer is derived not from original masters, but from the 1993 Laserdisc transfer (aside from the original Episode IV opening scroll taken from a best available original 1977 print), meaning that the film's 2.35:1 Panavision format is letterboxed into a non-anamorphic 4:3 video frame (appearing that way even on widescreen televisions.)[7][8]
Also, instead of using the original sound mixes from the initial theatrical releases, the 'bonus' DVD presentations use the 1993 laserdisc remixes (presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo). However, the Spanish and French audio tracks on the Star Wars DVD appear to be based on the original theatrical mono sound mix for the film (originally the most widely-heard original theatrical sound mix in 1977, now a rarity), not the Definitive Collection version. Certain sound effects from the 1993 mix are missing (such as all of the "exploding glass" sounds when Luke and Han blast the various cameras and such in the Death Star's detention center), and certain sounds have been added (such as metallic clicks when R2-D2 and Chewbacca press buttons on the Millennium Falcon's holographic chessboard). Luke Skywalker also says "Blast it, Wedge, where are you?" during the final battle on the alternate language tracks, something he only said in the theatrical mono mix. In all other versions of the film, he says, "Blast it, Biggs, where are you?"
The French and Spanish audio tracks for The Empire Strikes Back 2006 DVD also feature a different sound mix (apparently based on the initial 70 mm mix from 1980) than the 1993 Definitive Collection mix. This alternate mix features additional sounds that were not heard on the 35 mm and subsequent home video versions, but which were later reincorporated into the 1997 and 2004 mixes. Such sounds include additional R2-D2 beeps when Yoda rummages through Luke's supplies, which are missing from prior mixes, and additional TIE fighter engine sounds in the establishing shot of Darth Vader's Star Destroyer (after Luke Skywalker beheads the illusory Vader on Dagobah), which are missing from the prior 35 mm/home video sound mixes.
This set was dubbed a "Limited Edition", with the original "unaltered" movies being included as a second "bonus disc", and the "default" movie was the 2004 edition. As of today, copies can still be found on most store shelves. The only extras included on the "Bonus Disc" were an Xbox demo of Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy and a trailer for the game. Each movie disc had identical bonus content.
A box set of the 2006 DVDs with new artwork was released on November 4, 2008.[9]

At a ShoWest convention in 2005, George Lucas demonstrated new technology and stated that he is planning to release all six films in a new 3-D film format, beginning with either A New Hope or The Phantom Menace in 2007. In January 2007, StarWars.com's Questions & Answers section stated that Lucasfilm was busy with other upcoming media such as the Star Wars live-action TV series, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and media related to the 30th anniversary of Star Wars.[10] Thus the release was postponed indefinitely.

It has been widely rumored that Lucasfilm plans on re-releasing the 6-film saga in Blu-ray Disc format with many new features and changes; however, John Singh, spokesperson for Lucasfilm, has denied there are any plans. He was quoted as saying "Lucasfilm Ltd. has no plans to release any of the Star Wars movies on Blu-ray. Listings on Amazon.com or any other Web site are purely speculative and erroneous."[11]

Here is a partial list of the changes made to each of the original trilogy's films.

Although not as obvious as the 1997 Special Edition re-release of the original trilogy, there were still some alterations made between versions.


The 70 mm version included a large number of changes from the 35 mm version that was more widely seen.

Special coverage on CNN in 1997 notes that Lucas spent $10 million to rework his original 1977 film, which was roughly what it cost to film it originally. Three million dollars of that was spent on the audio track for the special edition. Lucas also spent $2.5 million each on Episodes V and VI. All of the films have newer versions of the 20th Century Fox and Lucasfilm production logos.
