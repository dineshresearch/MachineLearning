Bottled water
Bottled water is drinking water as a packaged food product, regulated by national and local agencies, that allows consumers to purchase and consume water at different locations. The dominant form is water packaged in bottles for individual consumption and retail sale. Another popular form is water that comes in larger glass or plastic jugs, intended for use in the office or home.


The U.S. is the largest consumer market for bottled water in the world, followed by Mexico, China, and Brazil.[1] In 2008, U.S. bottled water sales topped 8.6 billion gallons for 28.9% of the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage market, exceeding sales of all other beverages except carbonated soft drinks, followed by fruit juices and sports drinks.[2]

About 25% of U.S. bottled water sold is purified municipal water according to a four-year study by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).[3] Both Aquafina from PepsiCo and Dasani from The Coca-Cola Company originate from municipal water systems.[4] However according to the FDA, about 75 percent of bottled water sold in the U.S. comes from other sources, including "natural underground sources, which include rivers, lakes, springs and artesian wells." Federal regulations also require that the standard of identity be noted on the bottle label.

In the United States, bottled water is regulated by the Food & Drug Administration according to standards of identity, standards of quality and good manufacturing practices.[5]
Standards of identity define types of water for labeling purposes. To be called ground water, the water must not be under the direct influence of surface water. Water containing not less than 250 parts per million of total dissolved solids are mineral water. Artesian water comes from a well tapping a confined aquifer in which the water level stands at some height above the top of the aquifer; it may be collected with the assistance of external force to enhance the natural underground pressure. Water that has been produced by distillation, deionization, reverse osmosis or similar processes are purified or demineralized water. Sparkling water contains the same amount of carbon dioxide that it had at emergence from the source, although it may be removed and replenished in treatment. Spring water must be derived from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the Earth's surface. Sterile water water meets the requirements under "sterility tests" in the United States Pharmacopoeia. Well water is water that has been removed from a hole bored or drilled in the ground which taps into an aquifer.
Standards of quality regulate acceptable levels of the water's turbidity, color and odor, according to sample analysis. Exemptions are made according to aesthetically-based allowable levels, and do not relate to health concerns. An example is mineral water, which is exempt from allowable color levels.[5]

European Directive 80/777/EEC[6] â€“ modified by Directive 96/70/EC[7] â€“ deals with the marketing and exploitation of natural mineral waters in the European Union. The two main types of bottled water recognized are mineral water and spring water.
Broadly speaking, "mineral water" is groundwater that has emerged from the ground and flowed over rock. Treatment of mineral water is restricted to removal of unstable elements such as iron and sulfur compounds. Treatment for such minerals can only extend to filtration or decanting with oxygenation. Free carbon dioxide may be removed only by physical methods, and the regulations for introduction (or reintroduction) of CO2 are strictly defined. Disinfection of natural mineral water is completely prohibited, including the addition of any element that is likely to change bacterial colony counts. If natural mineral is effervescent, it must be labelled accordingly, depending on the origin of the carbon dioxide: naturally carbonated natural mineral water (no introduction of CO2); natural mineral water fortified with gas from the spring (reintroduction of CO2); carbonated natural mineral water (CO2 added following strict guidelines).
Council Directive 65/65/EEC[8] deals with bottled water that is considered a "medicinal product" and is thus excluded from the scope of the other regulation.

The global bottled water market grew by 7% in 2006 to reach a value of $60,938.1 million (60.9 billion). The market grew by 8.1% in 2006 to reach a volume of 115,393.5 million liters. In 2011, the market is forecast to have a value of $86,421.2 million (86.4 billion), an increase of 41.8% since 2006. In 2011, the market is forecast to have a volume of 174,286.6 million liters, an increase of 51% since 2006.[9]
The global rate of consumption more than doubled between 1997 and 2005.[10] Purified water is currently the leading global seller, with U.S. companies dominating the field, and natural spring water, purified water and flavored water being the fastest-growing market segments.[1]


One major criticism of bottled water concerns the bottles themselves. Individual use bottled water is generally packaged in Polyethylene terephthalate (PET). According to a NAPCOR study, PET water bottles account for 50% of all the PET bottles and containers collected by curbside recycling, and the recycling rate for water bottles is 23.4%, a 16.42% increase over the 2006 rate of 20.1%. PET bottled water containers make up one-third of 1 percent of the waste stream in the United States.[11]
The International Bottled Water Association also reports that the average weight of a plastic bottle water was 13.83 grams in 2007, compared to 18.90 grams in 2000, representing a 26.7% decline.[12] PepsiCo has since introduced a bottle weighing 10.9 grams and using 20 percent less plastic, which it says is the lightest bottle of its kind that is nationally distributed.[13]

Bottled water processed with distillation or reverse osmosis lacks fluoride ions which are sometimes naturally present in ground water. The drinking of distilled water may conceivably increase the risk of tooth decay due to a lack of this element.[14]
According to a 1999 NRDC study, about 22 percent of brands tested contained, in at least one sample, chemical contaminants at levels above strict state health limits, some of which may pose health risks, if consumed over a long period of time.[15] However, the NRDC report conceded that "[m]ost waters contained no detectable bacteria, and the levels of synthetic organic chemicals and inorganic chemicals of concern for which were tested were either below detection limits or well below all applicable standards."[16] Meanwhile, a report by the Drinking Water Research Foundation found that of all samples tested by NRDC, "federal FDA or EPA limits were allegedly exceeded only four times, twice for total coliforms and twice for fluorides."[17]

The Beverage Marketing Corporation defines the bottled water market segment as "retail PET, retail bulk, home and office delivery, vending, domestic sparkling and imports" but excluding "flavored and enhanced water."[2]

Bottled water competes in the marketplace with carbonated beverages sold in individual plastic bottles,[18] and is often considered a healthier substitute.[19]
According to the Container Recycling Institute, sales of flavored, noncarbonated drinks are expected to surpass soda sales by 2010.[20] In response, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have introduced new carbonated drinks that are fortified with vitamins and minerals, Diet Coke Plus and Tava, marketed as "sparkling beverages."[21]

In the United States, bottled water costs between $0.25 and $2 per bottle while tap water costs less than a penny.[22] In 1999, according to a NRDC study, U.S. consumers paid between 240 and 10,000 times more per gallon for bottled water than for tap water.[23] According to Bottledwaterblues.com, about 90% of manufacturer's costs is from making the bottle, label, and cap.[24]
The Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and World Wildlife Fund have all urged their supporters to consume less bottled water. Anti-bottled water campaigns and organizations, such as Corporate Accountability International, typically argue that bottled water is no better than tap water, and emphasize the environmental side-effects of disposable plastic bottles. These claims have been challenged by groups such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which dispute the research and claims about bottled water's impact on the environment.[25]
The Showtime series Penn & Teller: Bullshit! demonstrated, in a 2007 episode, that in a controlled setting, diners could not discern between bottled water and water from a garden hose behind the restaurant.[26]
The United Church of Christ, United Church of Canada, National Council of Churches, National Coalition of American Nuns and Presbyterians for Restoring Creation are among some of the religious organizations that have raised questions about whether or not the "privatization" of water is ethical. They regard the industrial purchase and repackaging at a much higher resale price of a basic resource as an unethical trend.[27]

It is not uncommon for business or individuals to subscribe to a bottled water service. Instead of selling drinking water in small individual-use bottles, the service supplies it in large, reusable (in the USA, typically 5 US gallons) containers. The containers are installed on a dispenser (or "cooler") which chills or heats the water and generally has valves on the front for dispensing. This practice eliminates the issue of disposing of packaging for individual serves while still providing the same product.

A number of companies worldwide, among which are a number of North American supermarket chains, have vending machines that dispense purified water into customer's own containers. This again obviates the costs and environmental issues involved in manufacturing, transporting, and disposing of plastic bottles. When offered in low-income areas, this practice makes purified water more affordable to local population.

Fiji Water has actively sought product placement in popular movies and TV shows, including "Desperate Housewives", "Entourage" and "Sex and the City". In the 2005 movie Jesus is Magic, comedian Sarah Silverman lampoons behavior of show business prima donnas with a tirade declaring she will drink only Fiji Water.[28]
