Books of the Bible
Books of the Bible are listed differently in the canons of Jews, and Catholic, Protestant, Greek Orthodox, Slavonic Orthodox, Georgian, Armenian Apostolic, Syriac and Ethiopian Churches, although there is substantial overlap. A table comparing the canons of some of these denominations appears below, for both the Old Testament and the New Testament. For a detailed discussion of the differences, see "Biblical canon."
The Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic churches may have minor differences in their lists of accepted books. The list given here for these churches is the most inclusive: if at least one Eastern church accepts the book, it is included here. The books included by the Roman Catholic Church are universally included in the Eastern canons.

A table cell with an asterisk (*) indicates that a book is present but in a different order. Empty cells indicate that a book is absent from that canon; such books are often called apocrypha, a term that is sometimes used specifically (and possibly pejoratively) to describe the books in the Catholic and Orthodox canon that are absent from the Protestant Bible; Orthodox and Catholic Christians describe these books as deuterocanonical, meaning 'of the second canon'.
Note that this table uses the spellings of the Douay-Rheims Bible in describing the Catholic biblical canon. More recent Catholic translations use similar or identical spellings (e.g. 1 Chronicles) as Protestant Bibles in those books which are jointly considered canonical.
