Backmasking
Subliminal messages
Backmasking (also known as backward masking)[1] is a recording technique in which a sound or message is recorded backward onto a track that is meant to be played forward. Backmasking is a deliberate process, whereas a message found through phonetic reversal may be unintentional.
Backmasking was popularized by The Beatles, who used backward vocals and instrumentation on their 1966 album Revolver.[2] Artists have since used backmasking for artistic, comedic, and satiric effect, on both analog and digital recordings. The technique has also been used to censor words or phrases for "clean" releases of songs.
Backmasking has been a controversial topic in the United States since the 1980s, when allegations from Christian groups of its use for Satanic purposes were made against prominent rock musicians, leading to record-burning protests and proposed anti-backmasking legislation by state and federal governments. Whether backmasked messages exist is in debate, as is whether backmasking can be used subliminally to affect listeners.


In 1877 Thomas Edison invented the phonograph, a device that allowed sound to be recorded and reproduced on a rotating cylinder with a stylus (or "needle") attached to a diaphragm mounted at the narrow end of a horn. Emile Berliner invented the familiar lateral-cut disc phonograph record in 1888. His design overtook the Edison phonograph in the 1920s, since Berliner's patent expired in 1918, and others were then free to utilize his invention.
In addition to recreating recorded sounds by placing the stylus on the cylinder or disc and rotating it in the same direction as during the recording, one could hear different sounds by rotating the cylinder or disc backwards.[3] In 1878 Edison noted that, when played backwards, "the song is still melodious in many cases, and some of the strains are sweet and novel, but altogether different from the song reproduced in the right way".[4] The backwards playing of records was advised as training for magicians by occultist Aleister Crowley, who suggested in his 1913 book Magick (Book 4) that an adept "train himself to think backwards by external means", one of which was to "listen to phonograph records, reversed."[5]
The 1950s saw the development of musique concr√®te, an avant-garde form of electronic music which involves editing together fragments of natural and industrial sounds, and the concurrent spread of the use of tape recorders in recording studios.[6] These two trends led to tape music compositions, composed on tape using techniques including reverse tape effects.[7]
The Beatles, who incorporated the techniques of concr√®te into their recordings, were responsible for popularizing the concept of backmasking.[2] Singer John Lennon and producer George Martin both claim they discovered the backward recording technique during the recording of 1966's Revolver; specifically the album tracks "Tomorrow Never Knows" and "I'm Only Sleeping," and the single "Rain".[8] Lennon stated that, while under the influence of marijuana, he accidentally played the tapes for "Rain" in reverse, and enjoyed the sound. The following day he shared the results with the other Beatles, and the effect was used first in the guitar solo for "Tomorrow Never Knows", and later in the coda of "Rain".[9][10] According to Martin, the band had been experimenting with changing the speeds of and reversing the "Tomorrow Never Knows" tapes, and Martin got the idea of reversing Lennon's vocals and guitar, which he did with a clip from "Rain". Lennon then liked the effect and kept it.[11][12] Regardless, "Rain" was the first song to feature a backmasked message: "Sunshine†‚Ä¶ Rain†‚Ä¶ When the rain comes, they run and hide their heads" (listen (info); the last line is the reversed first verse of the song).[13]

The Beatles were involved in the spread of backmasking both as a recording technique and as the center of a controversy. The latter has its roots in an event in 1969, when WKNR-FM DJ Russ Gibb received a phone call from a student at Eastern Michigan University who identified himself as "Tom". The caller asked Gibb about a rumor that Beatle Paul McCartney had died, and claimed that the Beatles song "Revolution 9" contained a backward message confirming the rumor. Gibb played the song backwards on his turntable, and heard "Turn me on, dead man†‚Ä¶ turn me on, dead man†‚Ä¶ turn me on, dead man‚Ä¶" (listen (info)).[14] Gibb began telling his listeners about what he called "The Great Cover-up",[15] and to the original clue were added various others, including the alleged backmasked message "Paul is a dead man, miss him, miss him, miss him", in "I'm So Tired".[14] The "Paul is dead" rumor popularized the idea of backmasking in popular music.[2]
Following Gibb's show, many more songs were found to contain audible phrases when reversed. Initially, the search was done mostly by fans of rock music, but in the late 1970s,[16] during the rise of the Christian right in the United States,[17] fundamentalist Christian groups began to claim that backmasked messages could bypass the conscious mind and reach the subconscious, where they would be unknowingly accepted by the listener.[18] In 1981, Christian DJ Michael Mills began stating on Christian radio programs that Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven" contained hidden messages that were heard by the subconscious.[19] In early 1982, the Praise the Lord Network's Paul Crouch hosted a show with self-described neuroscientist William Yarroll, who argued that rock stars were cooperating with the Church of Satan to place hidden subliminal messages on records.[20] Also in 1982, fundamentalist Christian pastor Gary Greenwald held public lectures on dangers of backmasking, along with at least one mass record-smashing.[21] During the same year, thirty North Carolina teenagers, led by their pastor, claimed that singers had been possessed by Satan, who used their voices to create backward messages, and held a record-burning at their church.[22]
Allegations of demonic backmasking were also made by social psychologists, parents, and critics of rock music,[23] as well as the Parents Music Resource Center (formed in 1985),[24] which accused Led Zeppelin of using backmasking to promote Satanism.[25] On the April 28, 1982 edition of the CBS Evening News, Dan Rather discussed the finding of possible backmasked messages, and played reversed sections of songs by Led Zeppelin, Electric Light Orchestra and Styx.[26]

One result of the furor was the firing of five radio DJs who had encouraged listeners to search for backward messages in their record collections.[16] A more serious consequence was legislation by the state governments of Arkansas and California. The 1983 California bill was introduced to prevent backmasking that "can manipulate our behavior without our knowledge or consent and turn us into disciples of the Antichrist".[27] Involved in the discussion on the bill was a California State Assembly Consumer Protection and Toxic Materials Committee hearing, during which "Stairway to Heaven" was played backwards, and William Yaroll testified.[28] The successful bill made the distribution of records with undeclared backmasking an invasion of privacy for which the distributor could be sued.[21] The Arkansas law passed unanimously in 1983, referenced albums by The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Electric Light Orchestra, Queen and Styx,[17] and mandated that records with backmasking include a warning sticker: "Warning: This record contains backward masking which may be perceptible at a subliminal level when the record is played forward." However, the bill was returned to the state senate by Governor Bill Clinton and defeated.[21] House Resolution 6363, introduced in 1982 by Representative Bob Dornan (R-California), proposed mandating a similar label;[29] the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Commerce, Transportation and Tourism and was never passed.[30] Government action was also called for in the legislatures of Texas and Canada.[21]
With the advent of compact discs in the 1980s, but prior to the advent of sound editing technology for personal computers in the 1990s, it became more difficult to listen to recordings backwards, and the controversy died down.[23]

Though the backmasking controversy peaked in the 1980s, the general belief in subliminal manipulation became more widespread in the United States during the following decade,[31] with belief in Satanic backmasking on records persisting into the 1990s.[32] At the same time, the development of sound editing software with audio reversal features simplified the process of reversing audio,[23] which previously could only be done with full fidelity using a professional tape recorder.[18] The Sound Recorder utility, included with Microsoft Windows from Windows 95 to Windows XP, allows one-click audio reversal,[33] as does popular open source sound editing software Audacity.[34] Following the growth of the Internet, backmasked message searchers used such software to create websites featuring backward music samples, which became a widely-used method of exploring backmasking in popular music.[23]

Backmasking has been used as a recording technique since the 1960s. In the era of magnetic tape sound recording, backmasking required that the source reel-to-reel tape actually be played backwards, which was achieved by first being wound onto the original takeup reel, then reversing the reels so as to use that reel as the source (this would reverse the stereo channels as well). Digital audio recording has greatly simplified the process.[35]
Backmasked words are unintelligible noise when played forward, but when played backwards are clear speech.[22] Listening to backmasked audio with most turntables requires disengaging the drive and rotating the album by hand in reverse[36] (though some can play records backwards[18]). With magnetic tape, the tape must be reversed and spliced back in to the cassette.[36] Compact discs were difficult to reverse when first introduced, but digital audio editors, which were first introduced in the late 1980s and became popular during the next decade,[37] allow easy reversal of audio from digital sources.[23]

Although the Satanic backmasking controversy involved mainly classic rock songs whose authors denied any intent to promote Satanism, backmasking has been used by heavy metal bands to deliberately insert messages in their lyrics or imagery. Bands have utilized Satanic imagery for commercial reasons. One of the most famous alleged uses of backmasking is found in the song by Led Zeppelin, Stairway to Heaven. If played backwards during the section in the lyrics that goes, "If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now. It's just a spring clean for the may queen. Yes there are two paths you can go by; but in the long run, there's still time to change the road you're on," some listeners claim to hear, "Here's to my sweet Satan. The one whose little path would make me sad, whose power is Satan. He'll give those with him 666. There was a little toolshed where he made us suffer, sad Satan." [38] For example, thrash metal band Slayer included at the start of the band's 1985 album Hell Awaits a deep backmasked voice chanting "Join Us" over and over at increasing volumes for 1 minute and 2 seconds until a deep voice says "Welcome Back."(listen (info)).[39][40][41] However, Slayer vocalist Tom Araya states that the band's use of Satanic imagery was "solely for effect".[42] Cradle of Filth, another band that has employed Satanic imagery, released a song entitled "Dinner at Deviant's Palace", consisting almost entirely of ambient sounds and a reversed reading of the Lord's Prayer[43] (a backwards reading of the Lord's Prayer is reportedly a major part of the Black Mass).[19][44]

Backmasking is often used for aesthetics, i.e., to enhance the meaning or sound of a track.[16] During the Judas Priest subliminal message trial, lead singer Rob Halford admitted to recording the words "In the dead of the night, love bites" backwards into the track "Love Bites", from the 1984 album Defenders of the Faith. Asked why he recorded the message, Halford stated that "When you're composing songs, you're always looking for new ideas, new sounds."[45]
A well-known example of a hidden message is recorded backwards into Pink Floyd's 1979 song "Empty Spaces": "‚Ä¶congratulations. You've just discovered the secret message. Please send your answer to Old Pink, care of the funny farm, Chalfont." (voice in background) "Roger! Carolyn is on the phone!"[46] This line may refer to former lead singer Syd Barrett, who is thought to have suffered a nervous breakdown years earlier.[46]
One backmasking technique is to reverse an earlier part of a song. Missy Elliott used this technique in one of her songs, "Work It",[47] as did Jay Chou ("You Can Hear", from Ye Hui Mei),[48] At the Drive-In ("300†MHz", from Vaya),[49] and Lacuna Coil ("Self Deception", from Comalies).[50] A related technique is to reverse an entire instrumental track. John Lennon originally wanted to do so with "Rain", but objections by producer George Martin and bandmate
