Paella
Paella (IPA:†[pa'e éa]) is a rice dish which originated in Spain's Valencian region near lake Albufera, a coastal lagoon in eastern Spain.[1] Many non-Spaniards view paella as a Spanish dish. Most Spaniards however, consider it to be a regional Valencian dish and Valencians, in turn, see paella as one of their identity symbols.
There are three widely known types of paella: Valencian paella (Spanish: paella valenciana), seafood paella (Spanish: paella de marisco) and mixed paella (Spanish: paella mixta); but there are many others as well. Valencian paella consists of white rice, green vegetables, meat, snails, beans and seasoning. Seafood paella replaces meat and snails with seafood and omits beans and green vegetables. Mixed paella is a free-style combination of meat, seafood, vegetables and sometimes beans.
Most paella chefs use Calasparra[2][3] or Bomba[3] rices for this dish. Other key ingredients include saffron, and olive oil.
This dish has gained considerable popularity throughout most of the Spanish-speaking world, including the Hispanic regions of the United States. It also enjoys moderate popularity throughout Western Europe.

Paella is a Catalan word[4] which derives from the Latin word patella for pan.[5] Patella is also akin to the French po√™le,[6] the Welsh padell,[7][8] the Italian padella, [9] the Old Spanish padilla[10] and the New Mexican Spanish puela.[11] These words have an Indoeuropean common root.[12][13]
Valencians use the word paella for all pans, including the specialized shallow pan used for cooking paellas. However, in most of Spain and throughout Latin America, the term paellera is more commonly used for this pan, though both terms are correct, as stated by the Royal Spanish Academy, the body responsible for regulating the Spanish language. Paelleras are traditionally round and shallow, made of polished steel with two handles.[14]
A common but inaccurate belief in the Arab world is that the word paella derives from the Arabic word for leftovers, baqiyah, (Arabic script:ÿ®ŸÇŸäÿ©) because it was customary among Arab sailors to combine leftovers of previous meals which purportedly led to a paella-like creation in Moorish Spain.[1]


The Moorish people of Al-Andalus often made casseroles of rice, fish and spices for family gatherings and religious feasts, thus establishing the custom of eating rice in Spain. This led to rice becoming a staple by the time the Catholics drove out the Muslims in the 15th century. Afterward many combined rice with vegetables, beans and dry cod, providing an acceptable meal for Lent. Fish always predominated with rice along Spain's eastern coast.[15]

On special occasions, 18th century Valencians used paelleras to cook rice in the open air of their orchards near lake Albufera. The rata de marjal (marsh rat) was one of the main ingredients of early paellas[16], along with eel and garrafones (butter beans).
The rat-eating habits of the people of Valencia's rice-growing region were immortalized by Vicente Blasco Ib√°√±ez in his novel Ca√±as y barro, a realist account about life among the fishermen peasants of the Albufera marshes in Valencia.[17]
Living standards rose with the sociological changes of the late 19th century in Spain, giving rise to reunions and outings in the countryside. By then the original ingredients were replaced by rabbit, chicken, duck, seafood and sometimes snails. This dish became so popular that in 1840 a local Spanish newspaper first used the phrase paella valenciana to refer to the recipe rather than the pan.[15]
The most widely used ingredient list of this era was as follows: short-grain white rice, butter beans, great northern beans, chicken, rabbit, snails (optional), duck (optional), runner beans, artichoke (a substitute for runner beans in the winter), tomatoes, fresh rosemary, salt, sweet paprika, saffron, garlic, olive oil and water.[15] (Poorer Valencians, however, sometimes used nothing more than snails for meat.) It's these ingredients, and only these, that Valencians insist go into making modern Valencian paella.

Coastal residents substituted seafood for meat and beans, thereby inventing seafood paella. Later, Spaniards mixed seafood into the original Valencian recipe and mixed paella was born.[18]
During the 20th century, paella's popularity spread past Spain's borders. As other cultures set out to make paella, the dish invariably acquired regional influences. Consequently, paella recipes went from being relatively simple to including a wide variety of seafood, meat, sausage, (the most popular being Spanish, chorizo)[19][20]vegetables and many different seasonings.[21] However, the most globally popular recipe is seafood paella.
In Spain, mixed paella is very popular. Some restaurants in Spain (and many in the United States) that serve this mixed version, refer to it as Valencian paella but Valencians insist only the original Valencian recipe can bear the name paella valenciana.

Paella is now an international dish with recipes calling for ingredients very different from paella's original version.[22]
Various international versions of paella are well known in Australia[23][24], Asia (especially the Philippines[25]), Latin America (very popular in Mexico and Venezuela), the U.S., and West European countries such as Portugal, Germany[26], Sweden[27], Norway[28] and Denmark[29].

According to tradition in Valencia, paella is cooked by men over an open fire, fueled by orange and pine branches along with pine cones. This produces an aromatic smoke which infuses the paella. Also, dinner guests traditionally eat directly out of the paellera.[30][15][18][1]


This recipe is standardized because Valencians consider it traditional and very much part of their culture. Rice in Valencian paella is never braised in oil, as pilau, though the paella made further southwest of Valencia often is.[30]

Recipes vary for this dish somewhat, even in Valencia. Below is a recipe by Juanry Segui, a prominent Valencian chef.[31]

There are countless mixed paella recipes. However, the following method is common to most of these. Seasoning depends greatly on individual preferences and regional influences. However, salt, saffron and garlic are almost always included.[32][33]

Once the rice is nearly done, the paella is removed from the heat and left to absorb the remaining water. Paella usually has a crispy, caramelized, toasted bottom (called socarrat in Valencia but pegado in Latin America) that is considered a delicacy. There are two ways to achieve socarrat/pegado: The first is to time the evaporation of the water properly with the completion of the rice; the second is to use a high flame while listening to the rice toast at the bottom of the pan. The chef then removes the paellera from the heat once the aroma of toasted rice wafts upwards. The paella then must sit for about five minutes before serving.

It has become a custom at mass gatherings in the Valencian Community (festivals, political campaigns, protests, etc.) to prepare enormous paellas, sometimes to win mention in the Guinness Book of World Records.[34] Chefs use gargantuan paelleras for these events.
Each year chefs from the region of Galicia compete for the title of "Paella King". The competition is held in a different town each year in that region.[citation needed]
Valencian restaurateur Juan Galbis claims to have made the world's largest paella with help from a team of workers on 2 October 2001. This paella fed about 110,000 people according to Galbis' website.[35] Galbis says this paella was even larger than his earlier world-record paella made on 8 March 1992 which fed about 100,000 people. Galbis's record-breaking 1992 paella is listed in Guinness[36]

Valencians do not refer to all saffron rice recipes as paella. Traditional Valencian cuisine offers recipes similar to paella valenciana and paella marisco such as arr√≥s al forn, arr√≥s a banda and arr√≥s en fesols i naps. The following is a list of other similar rice dishes:
