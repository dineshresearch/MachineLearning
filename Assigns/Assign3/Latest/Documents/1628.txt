Brigade de cuisine
Brigade de cuisine is a system of hierarchy found in restaurants and hotels in France that employ extensive staff and are commonly referred to as kitchen staff in English speaking countries. The concept was refined by Georges Auguste Escoffier, but evidence of brigade-style culinary arrangements can be found in late medieval French and English sources. This structured team system delegates responsibilities to different individuals that specialize in certain tasks.

Below is an exhaustive list of the different members of the kitchen brigade system. Only the largest of establishments would have an extensive staff of this size. As noted under certain titles, certain positions are combined into other positions when such a large staff is unnecessary.
