Mobile Network Code
A Mobile Network Code (MNC) is used in combination with a Mobile Country Code (MCC) (also known as a "MCC / MNC tuple") to uniquely identify a mobile phone operator/carrier using the GSM, CDMA, iDEN, TETRA and UMTS public land mobile networks and some satellite mobile networks. The ITU-T Recommendation E.212 defines mobile country codes.
The following tables contain the complete list of mobile phone operators. Country information is provided for completeness, though this information is best obtained from the Mobile Country Code page.
