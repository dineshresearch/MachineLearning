World population
The world population is the total number of living humans on Earth at a given time. As of April 2009, the earth's population is estimated to be about 6.77 billion.[1] The trend in world population has been of continuous growth since 400 AD, if not earlier,[2] although during much of the 14th century[3] there were significant short-term falls (especially in Europe) due to the Black Death. There were also short term falls at other times due to plague, for example in the mid 17th century.[3][4][2] The fastest rates of world population growth (above 1.8%) were seen briefly during the 1950s then for a longer period during the 1960s and 1970s (see graph). According to population projections, world population will continue to grow until around 2050. The 2008 rate of growth has almost halved since its peak of 2.2% per year, which was reached in 1963. World births have levelled off at about 137-million-per-year, since their peak at 163-million in the late 1990's, and are expected to remain constant. However, deaths are only around 56 million per year, and are expected to increase to 90 million by the year 2050. Since births outnumber deaths, the world's population is expected to reach about 9 billion by the year 2040.[5][6]

It is estimated that over 57 million people lived in the combined eastern and western Roman Empire (300â€“400 AD).[7] The Black Death pandemic in the 14th century may have reduced the world's population from an estimated 450 million to between 350 and 375 million in 1400.[8] During the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically. The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730-1749 to 31.8% in 1810-1829.[9] Europeâ€™s population doubled during the 18th century, from roughly 100 million to almost 200 million, and doubled again during the 19th century.[10]
Below is a table with historical and predicted population figures shown in millions.[11][12][13] [14]
The availability of historical population figures varies by region.
* Northern America comprises the northern countries and territories of North America: Canada, the United States, Greenland, Bermuda, and St. Pierre and Miquelon. Latin America comprises Middle America (Mexico, the nations of Central America, and the Caribbean) and South America.

Different regions have different rates of population growth. According to the above table, the growth in population of the different regions from 2000 to 2005 was:
In the 20th century, the world saw the biggest increase in its population in human history due to lessening of the mortality rate in many countries due to medical advances and massive increase in agricultural productivity attributed to the Green Revolution.[19][20][21]
In 2000, the United Nations estimated that the world's population was growing at the rate of 1.14% (or about 75 million people) per year,[22] down from a peak of 88 million per year in 1989. In the last few centuries, the number of people living on Earth has increased many times over. By the year 2000, there were 10 times as many people on Earth as there were 300 years ago. According to data from the CIA's 2005â€“2006 World Factbooks, the world human population increased by 203,800 every day.[23] The CIA Factbook increased this to 211,090 people every day in 2007, and again to 220,980 people every day in 2009.
Globally, the population growth rate has been steadily declining from its peak of 2.19% in 1963, but growth remains high in Latin America, the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa.[24]
In some countries there is negative population growth (i.e. net decrease in population over time), especially in Central and Eastern Europe (mainly due to low fertility rates) and Southern Africa (due to the high number of HIV-related deaths). Within the next decade, Japan and some countries in Western Europe are also expected to encounter negative population growth due to sub-replacement fertility rates.
The United Nations states that population growth is rapidly declining due to the demographic transition. The world population is expected to peak at 9.2 billion in 2050.[2]

There is currently no estimation on the exact day the world's population surpassed both the 1 and 2 billion marks. The day of 3 and 4 billion were not officially celebrated, but the International Database of the U.S. Census Bureau places them around July of 1959, and April of 1974. The United Nations did determine, and celebrate, the "Day of 5 billion" (July 11, 1987), and the "Day of 6 billion" (October 12, 1999). The U.S. Census bureau, International Programs division, currently estimated that the world reached 6 billion on April 21, 1999 (several months earlier than the official UN day). The "Day of 7 billion" has been targeted by the Census Bureau to be in February 2012.[25]
The day of 350 million for the United States will occur in the year 2023. At this point in time the population growth rate of the USA will equal and then surpass that of Latin America and the Caribbean.

Including some more estimates (together with an interpolated number for year 950), the world population has been doubled or will double in the following years (with two different starting points). Note how, during the 2nd millennium, each doubling has taken roughly half as long as the previous doubling. However, it is unlikely that there will be another doubling in the current century.[26]

Asia accounts for over 60% of the world population with almost 3800 million people. The People's Republic of China and India alone comprise 20% and 17% respectively. Africa follows with 840 million people, 12% of the world's population. Europe's 710 million people make up 11% of the world's population. North America is home to 514 million (8%), South America to 371 million (5.3%), and Australia to 21 million.
