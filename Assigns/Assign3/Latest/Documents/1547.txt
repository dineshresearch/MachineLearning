Surreal number
In mathematics, the surreal number system is an arithmetic continuum containing the real numbers as well as infinite and infinitesimal numbers, respectively larger or smaller in absolute value than any positive real number. The surreals share many properties with the reals, including a total order â‰¤ and the usual arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division); as such, they form an ordered Field.[1] In a rigorous set theoretic sense, the surreal numbers are the largest possible ordered field; all other ordered fields, such as the rationals, the reals, the rational functions, the Levi-Civita field, the superreal numbers, and the hyperreal numbers, are subfields of the surreals. The surreals also contain all transfinite ordinal numbers reachable in the set theory in which they are constructed.
The definition and construction of the surreals is due to John Horton Conway. They were introduced in Donald Knuth's 1974 book Surreal Numbers: How Two Ex-Students Turned on to Pure Mathematics and Found Total Happiness. This book is a mathematical novelette, and is notable as one of the rare cases where a new mathematical idea was first presented in a work of fiction. In his book, which takes the form of a dialogue, Knuth coined the term surreal numbers for what Conway had simply called numbers originally. Conway liked the new name, and later adopted it himself. Conway then described the surreal numbers and used them for analyzing games in his 1976 book On Numbers and Games.

A form is a pair of sets, called its left set L and its right set R; it is written { L | R }. (When L and R are given as lists of elements, the braces around them can be omitted.) If there is no combination of x in L and y in R such that xâ‰¥y, the form is numeric. Either or both of L and R may be the empty set; without knowing anything about the potential elements of L and R, or about the comparison operation â‰¥, one can exhibit the numeric form { { } | { } }, also written { | }.
Construction Rule
The numeric forms are placed in equivalence classes; each such equivalence class is a surreal number. The equivalence class containing { | } is labeled 0; in other words, { | } is a form of the surreal number 0. The elements of L and R are drawn from the universe of the surreal numbers (not of forms, but of their equivalence classes). The recursive definition of surreal numbers is completed by defining comparison and equivalence:
Comparison Rule
A ordering relationship must have the property that x = y (i. e., x â‰¤ y and y â‰¤ x are both true) only when x and y are the same object. This is not the case for surreal number forms, but is true by construction for surreal numbers.
Equivalence Rule
This group of definitions is recursive, and requires some form of mathematical induction to define the universe of objects (forms and numbers) that occur in them. The only surreal numbers reachable via finite induction are the dyadic fractions; a wider universe is reachable given some form of transfinite induction.
Induction Rule
The base case is actually a special case of the induction rule, with 0 taken as a label for the "least ordinal". Since there exists no Si with i < 0, the expression  is the empty set; the only subset of the empty set is the empty set, and therefore S0 consists of a single surreal form { | } lying in a single equivalence class 0.
The first iteration of the induction rule produces the three numeric forms { | 0 } < { | } < { 0 | } (the form { 0 | 0 } is non-numeric because 0â‰¤0). The equivalence class containing { 0 | } is labeled 1 and the equivalence class containing { | 0 } is labeled âˆ’1. These three labels have a special significance in the axioms that define a ring; they are the additive identity (0), the multiplicative identity (1), and the additive inverse of 1 (âˆ’1). The arithmetic operations defined below are consistent with these labels.
For every i < n, since every valid form in Si is also a valid form in Sn, all of the numbers in Si also appear in Sn (as supersets of their representation in Si). (The set union expression appears in our construction rule, rather than the simpler form Sn-1, so that the definition also makes sense when n is a limit ordinal.) Numbers in Sn that are a superset of some number in Si are said to have been inherited from generation i. The smallest value of Î± for which a given surreal number appears in SÎ± is called its birthday. For example, the birthday of 0 is 0, and the birthday of âˆ’1 is 1.
A second iteration of the construction rule yields the following ordering of equivalence classes:
Comparison of these equivalence classes is consistent irrespective of the choice of form. Three observations follow:
The informal interpretations of { 1 | } and { | âˆ’1 } are "the number just after 1" and "the number just before âˆ’1" respectively; their equivalence classes are labeled 2 and âˆ’2. The informal interpretations of { 0 | 1 } and { âˆ’1 | 0 } are "the number halfway between 0 and 1" and "the number halfway between âˆ’1 and 0" respectively; their equivalence classes are labeled 1/2 and âˆ’1/2. These labels will also be justified by the rules for surreal addition and multiplication below.
The equivalence classes at each stage n of induction may be characterized by their n-complete forms (each containing as many elements as possible of previous generations in its left and right sets). Either this complete form contains every number from previous generations in its left or right set, in which case this is the first generation in which this number occurs; or it contains all numbers from previous generations but one, in which case it is a new form of this one number. We retain the labels from the previous generation for these "old" numbers, and write the ordering above using the old and new labels:
The third observation extends to all surreal numbers with finite left and right sets. (For infinite left or right sets, this is valid in an altered form, since infinite sets might not contain a maximal or minimal element.) The number { 1, 2 | 5, 8 } is therefore equivalent to { 2 | 5 }; one can establish that these are forms of 3 by using the birthday property, which is a consequence of the rules above.
Birthday property

The addition, negation (additive inverse), and multiplication of surreal number forms x = { XL | XR } and y = { YL | YR } are defined by three recursive formulas. Negation is simplest:
Negation
This formula involves the negation of the surreal numbers appearing in the left and right sets of x, which is to be understood as the result of choosing a form of the number, evaluating the negation of this form, and taking the equivalence class of the resulting form. This only makes sense if the result is the same irrespective of the choice of form of the operand. This can be proven inductively using the fact that the numbers occurring in XL and XR are drawn from generations earlier than that in which the form x first occurs, and observing the special case:
The definition of addition is also a recursive formula:
Addition
This formula involves sums of one of the original operands and a surreal number drawn from the left or right set of the other. These are to be understood as the result of choosing a form of the numeric operand, performing the sum of the two forms, and taking the equivalence class of the resulting form. This only makes sense if the result is the same irrespective of the choice of form of the numeric operand. This can also be proven inductively with the special cases:
(The latter two cases are of course themselves proven inductively.)
The recursive formula for multiplication contains arithmetic expressions involving the operands and their left and right sets, such as the expression XRy + xYR âˆ’ XRYR that appears in the left set of the product of x and y. This is to be understood as the set of surreal numbers resulting from choosing one number from each set that appears in the expression and evaluating the expression on these numbers. (In each individual evaluation of the expression, only one number is chosen from each set, and is substituted in each place where that set appears in the expression.)
This depends, in turn, on the ability to (a) multiply pairs of surreal numbers drawn from the left and right sets of x and y to get a surreal number, and negate the result; (b) multiply the surreal number form x or y and a surreal number drawn from the left or right set of the other operand to get a surreal number; and (c) add the resulting surreal numbers. This again involves special cases, this time containing 0 = { | }, the multiplicative identity 1 = { 0 | }, and its additive inverse -1 = { | 0 }.
Multiplication
It can be shown that these formulas are consistent, in the sense that:
With these rules one can now verify that the numbers found in the first few generations were properly labeled. The construction rule is repeated to obtain more generations of surreals:
For each natural number (finite ordinal) n, all numbers generated in Sn are dyadic fractions, i.e., can be written as an irreducible fraction  where a and b are integers and 0 â‰¤ b < n.
The class of all surreal numbers that are generated in some Sn for finite n may be denoted as S* = . Since every Sn is well-ordered, so is S*; in particular, one may form the three classes S0 = { 0 }, S+ = , and S- = , and state that S* is the union of these three classes. No individual Sn is closed under addition and multiplication (except S0), but S* is; it is the subring of the rationals consisting of all dyadic fractions.
At an appropriate stage of transfinite induction, the surreal numbers may be expected to form a category on which the addition and multiplication operations (as well as the surreal construction step) are closed, and in which the multiplicative inverse of every nonzero number can be found. Assuming that one can find such a class, the surreal numbers, with their ordering and these algebraic operations, constitute an ordered field, with the caveat that they do not form a set but a proper class. In fact, it is a very special ordered field: the biggest one. Every other ordered field can be embedded in the surreals. (See also the definition of rational numbers and real numbers.)

Let there be an ordinal Ï‰ greater than the natural numbers, and define SÏ‰ as the set of all surreal numbers generated by the construction rule from subsets of S*. (This is the same inductive step as before, since the ordinal number Ï‰ is the smallest ordinal that is larger than all natural numbers; however, the set union appearing in the inductive step is now an infinite union of finite sets, and so this step can only be performed in a set theory that allows such a union.) A unique infinitely large positive number occurs in SÏ‰:
SÏ‰ also contains objects that can be identified as the rational numbers. For example, the Ï‰-complete form of the fraction 1/3 is given by:
The product of this form of 1/3 with any form of 3 is a form whose left set contains only numbers less than 1 and whose right set contains only numbers greater than 1; the birthday property implies that this product is a form of 1.
Not only do all the rest of the rational numbers appear in SÏ‰; the remaining finite real numbers do too. For example

The only infinities in SÏ‰ are Ï‰ and -Ï‰; but there are other non-real numbers in SÏ‰ among the reals. Consider the smallest positive number in SÏ‰:
This number is larger than zero but less than all positive dyadic fractions. It is therefore an infinitesimal number, often labeled Îµ. The only infinitesimals in SÏ‰ are Îµ and its opposite -Îµ. The Ï‰-complete forms of Îµ (resp. -Îµ) is the same as differ the Ï‰-complete form of 0 except that 0 is included in the left (resp. right) set.
For every dyadic fraction x in S*, x+Îµ and x-Îµ are infinitely good approximations of x. By definition
So that x+Îµ and x-Îµ are indeed the best approximation of x above and below.
One can determine the relationship between Ï‰ and Îµ by multiplying them to obtain:
This expression is only well-defined in a set theory which permits transfinite induction up to . In such a system, one can demonstrate that all the elements of the left set of Ï‰ Â· Îµ are positive infinitesimals and all the elements of the right set are positive infinities, and therefore Ï‰ Â· Îµ is the oldest positive finite number, i. e., 1. Consequently,
Some authors systematically use Ï‰âˆ’1 in place of the symbol Îµ.
Contents of SÏ‰ Given any x = { L | R } in SÏ‰, we are in one of the following case:
Because every real number can be approximated by a dyadic fraction, we get all the real numbers. In addition, SÏ‰ contains two infinites Ï‰ and -Ï‰, as well as their (multiplicative) inverse, the infinitesimals Îµ and -Îµ.
Note however that SÏ‰ is not an algebric field as Ï‰2=Ï‰ Ï‰={Ï‰|}, is in SÏ‰2, but not in SÏ‰.
This construction of the real numbers differs from the Dedekind cuts of standard analysis in that it starts from dyadic fractions rather than general rationals and naturally identifies each dyadic fraction in SÏ‰ with its forms in previous generations. The rationals are not an identifiable stage in the the surreal construction; they are merely the subset Q of SÏ‰ containing all elements x such that x b = a for some a and some nonzero b, both drawn from S*. By demonstrating that Q is closed under individual repetitions of the surreal arithmetic operations, one can show that it is a field; and by showing that every element of Q is reachable from S* by a finite series (no more than two, actually) of arithmetic operations including multiplicative inversion, one can show that Q is strictly smaller than the subset of SÏ‰ identified with the reals.

Continuing to perform transfinite induction beyond SÏ‰ produces more ordinal numbers Î±, each represented as the largest surreal number having birthday Î±. (This is essentially a definition of the ordinal numbers resulting from transfinite induction.) The first such ordinal is Ï‰+1 = { Ï‰ | }. There is another positive infinite number in generation Ï‰+1:
It is important to observe that the surreal number Ï‰âˆ’1 is not an ordinal; the ordinal Ï‰ is not the successor of any ordinal. This is a surreal number with birthday Ï‰+1, which is labeled Ï‰âˆ’1 on the basis that it coincides with the sum of Ï‰ = { 1, 2, 3, 4, ... | } and âˆ’1 = { | 0 }. Similarly, there are two new infinitesimal numbers in generation Ï‰+1:
At a later stage of transfinite induction, there is a number larger than Ï‰+k for all natural numbers k:
This number may be labeled Ï‰ + Ï‰ both because its birthday is Ï‰ + Ï‰ (the first ordinal number not reachable from Ï‰ by the successor operation) and because it coincides with the surreal sum of Ï‰ and Ï‰; it may also be labeled 2Ï‰ because it coincides with the product of Ï‰ = { 1, 2, 3, 4, ... | } and 2 = { 1 | }. It is the second limit ordinal; reaching it from Ï‰ via the construction step requires a transfinite induction on . This involves an infinite union of infinite sets, which is a "stronger" set theoretic operation than the previous transfinite induction required.
Note that the conventional addition and multiplication of ordinals does not always coincide with these operations on their surreal representations. The sum of ordinals 1 + Ï‰ equals Ï‰, but the surreal sum is commutative and produces 1 + Ï‰ = Ï‰ + 1 > Ï‰. The addition and multiplication of the surreal numbers associated with ordinals coincides with the natural sum and natural product of ordinals.
Just as 2Ï‰ is bigger than Ï‰+n for any natural number n, there is a surreal number Ï‰/2 that is infinite but smaller than Ï‰âˆ’n for any natural number n.
where x âˆ’ Y = { x âˆ’ y | y in Y }. It can be identified as the product of Ï‰ and the form { 0 | 1 } of 1/2. The birthday of Ï‰/2 is the limit ordinal 2Ï‰.
Labels for the surreal numbers that arise in later stages of transfinite induction are determined by reference to the rules of ordinal arithmetic and of surreal exponentiation.
