Polychlorinated biphenyl
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a class of organic compounds with 1 to 10 chlorine atoms attached to biphenyl which is a molecule composed of two benzene rings each containing six carbon atoms. The chemical formula for all PCBs is C12H10-xClx.
PCB were used as dielectric fluids in transformers and capacitors, coolants, lubricants, stabilizing additives in flexible PVC coatings of electrical wiring and electronic components, pesticide extenders, cutting oils, flame retardants, hydraulic fluids, sealants (used in caulking, etc), adhesives, wood floor finishes,[1] paints, de-dusting agents, and in carbonless copy paper.[2]
PCB production was banned in the 1970s due to the high toxicity of most PCB congeners and mixtures. PCBs are classified as persistent organic pollutants which bioaccumulate in animals.

PCB congeners are odorless, tasteless, clear to pale-yellow, viscous liquids. They are formed by electrophilic chlorination of biphenyl with chlorine gas. There are theoretically 209 different PCB congeners, although only about 130 of these were found in commercial PCB mixtures.[3] Commercial PCBs preparations are usually mixtures of 50 or more PCB congeners.[3] Commercial PCB mixtures are clear to pale-yellow, viscous liquids (the more highly chlorinated mixtures are more viscous and more yellow - for example , Aroclor 1260 is a sticky yellowish resin). PCBs have low water solubilities â€” 0.0027-0.42 ng/L for Aroclors,[2] and low vapor pressures at room temperature, but they have high solubilities in most organic solvents, oils, and fats. They have high dielectric constants, very high thermal conductivity,[2] high flash points (170-380Â°C)[2] and are chemically almost inert, being extremely resistant to oxidation, reduction, addition, elimination, and electrophilic substitution.[4] The density varies from 1.182 to 1.566 kg/L.[2] Other physical and chemical properties vary widely across the class. As the degree of chlorination increases, melting point and lipophilicity increase, but vapour pressure and water solubility decrease.[2]
PCBs readily penetrate skin, PVC (polyvinyl chloride), and latex (natural rubber); organic solvents such as kerosene increase the rate of skin absorption.[5] PCB-resistant materials include Viton, polyethylene, polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), butyl rubber, nitrile rubber, and Neoprene.[5]
PCBs are very stable compounds and do not degrade readily. They may be destroyed by chemical, thermal, and biochemical processes, though it is extremely difficult to achieve full destruction, and there is the risk of creating extremely toxic dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans through partial oxidation. Because of the high thermodynamic stability of PCBs, all degradation mechanisms are difficult to sustain. Intentional degradation as a treatment of unwanted PCBs generally requires high heat or catalysis. Environmental and metabolic degradation generally proceeds quite slowly relative to most other compounds.

Commercial PCB mixtures were marketed as Apirolio in Italy, Ascarel in Brazil, Aroclor by Monsanto in USA and UK, Asbestol in USA, Askarel in USA and UK, Bakola131 in USA, Chlorextol in USA, Clophen by Bayer in Germany, Delor in Czechoslovakia, Fenclor in Italy, Hydol in USA, Inerteen by Westinghouse in the USA, Kanechlor by Kanegafuchi in Japan, Noflamol in, Phenoclor and PyralÃ¨ne by Prodolec in France, Pyranol and Pyrenol by General Electric in USA, Pyroclor in UK, Saft-Kuhl in USA, Santotherm by Mitsubishi in Japan, Sovol and Sovtol in the former USSR, and Therminol in USA.[2][6]

PCBs were used as coolants and insulating fluids for transformers and capacitors, plasticizers in paints and cements, stabilizing additives in flexible PVC coatings of electrical wiring and electronic components, pesticide extenders, cutting oils, reactive flame retardants, lubricating oils, hydraulic fluids, sealants (for caulking in schools and commercial buildings[1]), adhesives, wood floor finishes (such as Fabulon and other products of Halowax in the U.S.),[1] paints, de-dusting agents, water-proofing compounds, casting agents, vacuum pump fluids, fixatives in microscopy, surgical implants, and in carbonless copy ("NCR") paper.[2]

PCBs, originally termed "chlorinated diphenyls," were commercially produced as complex mixtures containing multiple isomers at different degrees of chlorination. In the United States, commercial production of PCBs was taken over in 1929 by Monsanto from Swann Chemical Company. Manufacturing levels increased in response to the electrical industry's need for a "safer" (than flammable mineral oil) cooling and insulating fluid for industrial transformers and capacitors. PCBs were also commonly used as stabilizing additives in the manufacture of flexible PVC coatings for electrical wiring and electronic components to enhance the heat and fire resistance of the PVC.[7]
The toxicity associated with PCBs and other chlorinated hydrocarbons, including polychlorinated naphthalenes was recognized very early due to a variety of industrial incidents [8]. A conference about the hazards was organized at Harvard School of Public Health in 1937, and a number of publications referring to the toxicity of various chlorinated hydrocarbons were published before 1940 [9]. Robert Brown reminded chemists in 1947 that Arochlors were "objectionably toxic. Thus the maximum permissible concentration for an 8-hr. day is 1 mg. per cu.m. of air. They also produce a "serious and disfiguring dermatitis".[10] However, PCB manufacture and use continued with few restraints until the 1970s.
PCBs are persistent organic pollutants and have entered the environment through both use and disposal. The environmental transport of PCBs is complex and nearly global in scale. The public, legal, and scientific concerns about PCBs arose from research indicating they were likely carcinogens having the potential to adversely impact the environment and therefore undesirable as commercial products. Despite active research spanning five decades, extensive regulatory actions, and an effective ban on their production since the 1970s, PCBs still persist in the environment and remain a focus of attention.[2]
The only North American producer, Monsanto, marketed PCBs under the trade name Aroclor from 1930 to 1977. These were sold under trade names followed by a 4 digit number. The first two digits generally refer to the number of carbon atoms in the biphenyl skeleton (for PCBs this is 12), the second two numbers indicate the percentage of chlorine by mass in the mixture. Thus, Aroclor 1260 has 12 carbon atoms and contains 60% chlorine by mass. An exception is Aroclor 1016, which also has 12 carbon atoms, but has 42% chlorine by mass. Different Aroclors were used at different times and for different applications. In electrical equipment manufacturing in the USA, Aroclor 1260 and Aroclor 1254 were the main mixtures used before 1950, Aroclor 1242 was the main mixture used in the 1950s and 1960s until it was phased out in 1971 and replaced by Aroclor 1016.[2]
Manufacture peaked in the 1960s, by which time the electrical industry had lobbied the U.S. Congress to make them mandatory safety equipment. In 1966, they were determined by Swedish chemist Dr. Soren Jensen to be an environmental contaminant[11], and it was Dr. Jensen, according to a 1994 article in Sierra, who named them PCBs. Previously, they had simply been called "phenols" or referred to by various trade names, such as Aroclor, Kennechlor, Pyrenol, Chlorinol and others.
Their commercial utility was based largely on their chemical stability, including low flammability, and desirable physical properties, including electrical insulating properties. Their chemical and physical stability has also been responsible for their continuing persistence in the environment, and the lingering interest decades after regulations were imposed to control environmental contamination.
In 1972, PCB production plants existed in Austria, the then Federal Republic of Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Spain, USSR, and USA.[2]
In 1973 the use of PCBs was banned in "open" or "dissipative" sources, such as:
However, they continued to be allowed in "totally enclosed uses" such as transformers and capacitors, which, in certain failure modes or out-of-specification conditions, can leak, catch fire, or explode. It was Ward B. Stone of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation who first published his findings in the early 1970s that PCBs were leaking from transformers and had contaminated the soil at the bottom of utility poles[citation needed]. Concern over the toxicity and persistence (chemical stability) of PCBs in the environment led the United States Congress to ban their domestic production in 1979[12], although some use continues in closed systems such as capacitors and transformers.
"Enclosed uses" of PCBs include:
In the UK, closed uses of PCBs in new equipment were banned in 1981, when nearly all UK PCB synthesis ceased, but closed uses in existing equipment containing in excess of 5 litres of PCBs were not stopped until December 2000.[13]
In Japan, PCBs were first produced by Kanegafuchi Chemical Co. Ltd. (Kaneka) in 1954 and production continued until 1972 when the Japanese government banned the production, use, and import of PCBs.[2]
Estimates have put the total global production of PCBs on the order of 1.5 million tons. The United States was the single largest producer with over 600,000 tons produced between 1930 and 1977. The European region follows with nearly 450,000 tons through 1984. It is unlikely that a full inventory of global PCB production will ever be accurately tallied, as there were factories in Poland, East Germany, and Austria that produced unknown amounts of PCBs.[14]


Between approximately 1947 and 1977 General Electric Company (GE) released up to 1,300,000 pounds (590,000 kg) of PCBs into the Hudson River[15]. The PCBs came from the company's two capacitor manufacturing plants at Hudson Falls and Fort Edward in New York State.[15]
In 1976, because of concern over continuing high levels of PCBs in local fish and other aquatic organisms, and the unacceptable risk to the health of consumers of such fish, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation banned all fishing in the Upper Hudson River, as well as commercial fishing of striped bass and several other species in the Lower Hudson River,[16][15] and also issued advisories restricting the consumption of fish caught within a 20-mile (30 km) long segment of the Hudson River from Hudson Falls to Troy.[15][17]
There have been many programs of remediation work to reduce the PCB pollution. In 1984, approximately 200 miles (320 km) of the Hudson River was designated a Superfund site, and attempts to cleanup the Upper Hudson River began, including the removal in 1977-8 of 180,000 cubic yards (140,000 m3) of contaminated river sediments near Fort Edward.[16] In 1991, further PCB pollution was found at Bakers Falls near the former GE Hudson Falls factory, and a program of remediation was started.[16] In August 1995, a 40-mile (64 km) reach of the Upper Hudson was re-opened to fishing but only on a catch-and-release basis.[16] Removal of contaminated soil from Rogers Island was completed in December 1999.[16] In 2002, the United States Environmental Protection Agency announced a further 2,650,000 cubic yards (2,030,000 m3) of contaminated sediments in the Upper Hudson River would be removed.

From the late 1950s through 1977, Westinghouse Electric used PCBs in the manufacture of capacitors in its Bloomington, Indiana plant. Reject capacitors were hauled and dumped in area salvage yards and landfills. Workers also dumped PCB oil down factory drains which contaminated the city sewage treatment plant.[citation needed] The City of Bloomington gave away the sludge to area farmers and gardeners, creating anywhere from 200 to 2000 sites which remain unaddressed. Over 2 million pounds of PCBs were estimated to have been dumped in Monroe and Owen Counties, which would make it the biggest concentration of PCBs in the world.[citation needed] Although federal and state authorities have been working on the site remediations, many areas remain contaminated. Concerns have been raised regarding the removal of PCBs from the karst limestone topography, and regarding the possible disposal options. To date, the Westinghouse Bloomington PCB Superfund site case does not have a RI/FS (Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study) and ROD (Record of Decision), although Westinghouse signed a US Department of Justice Consent Decree in 1985.[citation needed] On February 15, 2008, Monroe County approved a plan to clean up the 3 remaining contaminated sites in the City of Bloomington, at a cost of $9.6m to CBS Corp., the successor of Westinghouse.

Much of the Great Lakes area is still heavily polluted with PCBs, despite extensive remediation work.[19] Locally caught fresh water fish and shellfish are contaminated with PCBs and their consumption is restricted.
From 1959 to 1971, Waukegan Harbor in Illinois on Lake Michigan was contaminated with PCB's discharged by the Outboard Marine Corp.

On the evening of Saturday December 6th 2008 a number of Irish news sources reported that testing had revealed "extremely high"[20] levels of PCBs in pork products, ranging from 80 to 200 times the EU's upper safe limit of 1.5 pg/Î¼g i.e. 0.12 to 0.3 parts per billion.[21][22] The PCB levels involved are small in comparison to other contamination incidents, indeed in 1986 the breast milk of healthy nursing mothers in the US contained between 1020 to 1770 ppb of PCBs and the PCB contaminated rice-bran oil that caused mass poisoning (Yu-Cheng) in Taiwan in 1979 contained between 53,000 to 99,000 ppb of PCBs.[23][24][25]
Brendan Smith, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries & Food, stated that pork contamination was caused by PCB contaminated feed that was used on 9 out of the 400 of Ireland's pig farms and only one feed supplier was involved.[21][26] Smith added that 38 beef farms also used the same contaminated feed, but those farms were quickly isolated and no contaminated beef entered the food chain.[27] While the contamination was limited to just 9 pig farms, the Irish government requested the immediate withdrawal and disposal of all pork-containing products produced in Ireland and purchased since September 1st 2008.
This request for withdrawal of pork products was confirmed in a press release by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on December 6th.[28]

PCBs have been detected globally in the atmosphere, from the most urbanized areas that are the centers for PCB pollution, to regions north of the Arctic Circle. The atmosphere serves as the primary route for global transport of PCBs, particularly for those congeners with 1 to 4 chlorine atoms.
Atmospheric concentrations of PCBs tend to be lowest in rural areas, where they are typically in the picogram per cubic meter range, higher in suburban and urban areas, and highest in city centres, where they can reach 1 ng/mÂ³ or more. In Milwaukee, an atmospheric concentration of 1.9 ng/mÂ³ has been measured, and this source alone was estimated to account for 120 kg/year of PCBs entering Lake Michigan.[29] Concentrations as high a
