Nerd Pride Day
Nerd Pride Day, or Geek Pride Day, is an initiative which claims the right of every person to be a nerd or a geek. Of Spanish origin ("día del orgullo friki" in Spain), it is celebrated nowadays among Spanish frikis (an equivalent of geeks and nerds).[1]
This day is celebrated on May 25 since 2006, celebrating the premiere of the first Star Wars movie in 1977.

In 2006, this day was celebrated for the first time all over Spain and on the Internet, thanks to the publicity given by some media as:
The biggest concentration took place in Madrid, where 300 Geeks demonstrated their pride together with a human pacman.

In 2007, the celebration counted with more help from Official institutions (as the Price Circus in Madrid) and has been more widely celebrated throughout Spain. Official acts were announced in Pilar de la Horadada, Cádiz, Huesca, Calaf, Huelva and Valencia. A Nerd Blood Donation campaign took place. Among other acts, the movie "Gritos en el pasillo" ("Screams in the corridor") was presented.

In 2008, Geek Pride Day crossed the Atlantic, and was officially celebrated in America, where it was heralded by numerous bloggers, coalescing around the launch of the GeekPrideDay website. Math author, Euler Book Prize winner, and geek blogger John Derbyshire not only did a shout out, but announced [2] that he would be appearing in the Fifth Avenue parade, dressed as number 57, on the prime number float - prompting some bloggers to say they'd be looking for him.

Nerd Pride Day is set to come to Canada in May 2009, with festivities planned in Ottawa, Canada, the capital city. Ottawa is home to the Canada Science and Technology Museum as well, the Ottawa Chess Club, and a notable research centre in Canada [3]

A manifesto was created to celebrate the first Nerd Pride Day which included the following list of basic rights and responsibilities of nerds.[1]
