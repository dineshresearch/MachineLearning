World Community Grid
World Community Grid (WCG) is an effort to create the world's largest public computing grid to tackle scientific research projects that benefit humanity.[3] Launched November 16, 2004, it is funded and operated by IBM with client software currently available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and FreeBSD operating systems.[4][5]
Using the idle time of computers around the world, World Community Grid's research projects have analyzed aspects of the human genome, HIV, dengue, muscular dystrophy, and cancer. The organization has so far partnered with nearly 400 other companies and organizations to assist in the work and has over 432,000 registered user accounts.

IBM and other research participants sponsored the United Devices Smallpox Research Grid Project to accelerate the discovery of a cure for smallpox. The smallpox study used a massive distributed computing grid to analyze compounds' effectiveness against smallpox.[6] The project allowed scientists to screen 35 million potential drug molecules against several smallpox proteins to identify good candidates for developing into smallpox treatments. In the first 72 hours, 100,000 results were returned. By the end of the project, 44 strong treatment candidates had been identified.[7] Based on the success of the Smallpox study, IBM announced on November 16, 2004 the creation of World Community Grid with the goal of creating a technical environment where other humanitarian research could be processed.[6][1]
World Community Grid initially only supported Windows, using the proprietary Grid MP software from United Devices which powered the grid.org distributed computing projects. Demand for Linux support led to the addition in November 2005 of open source BOINC grid technology which powers projects such as SETI@home and Climateprediction.[8] Mac OS X and Linux are now officially supported.[4]
As of March 24, 2009, World Community Grid had over 434,000 registered user accounts with over 1.2 million registered computers. Over the course of the project, over 226,000 years of computing time have been donated and over 254 million workunits have been completed. [1]

The World Community Grid software uses the idle time of Internet-connected computers to perform research calculations.[9] Users install WCG client software onto their computers. This software works in the background, using spare system resources to process work for WCG.[10][9] When a piece of work or workunit is completed, the client software sends it back to WCG over the Internet and downloads a new workunit.[11][3] To ensure accuracy, the WCG servers send out multiple copies of each workunit.[12] Then, when the results are received, they are collected and validated against each other.[13][14]
Users may choose to use graphics output by the current workunit as a screensaver.
While many public computing grids such as SETI@home and Folding@home are devoted to a single project, World Community Grid offers multiple humanitarian projects under a single umbrella. Projects are approved by an advisory board, with members from many major research institutions and universities, as well as the U.S. federal government and WHO.[15][16] Users are included in all projects by default, but may opt out of projects as they choose.[17]
When World Community Grid launched, they used the proprietary Grid MP client from United Devices. After adding support for the open source BOINC client in 2005, World Community Grid eventually discontinued the Grid MP client and consolidated on the BOINC platform in 2008.[18]
Even though WCG makes use of open source client software, the actual applications that perform the scientific calculations may not be. However, several of the science applications are available under a free license, although the source is not available directly from WCG.[19]

Because the World Community Grid software increases CPU usage by consuming unused processing time, it is possible for the software to cause abnormal behavior on volunteered computers. Despite the unobtrusive nature of the software, decreases in system performance could still occur. High CPU usage could also cause a computer to overheat.
The BOINC client avoids this using a variety of limits that suspend computation when there are insufficient free resources. Unlike other BOINC projects, World Community Grid set the BOINC defaults conservatively, making the chances of computer damage extremely small. The default CPU throttle is 60%. The throttle is coarse-grained; for example, if usage is set to 60% it will work at 100% for 3 seconds, then at 0% for 2 seconds, resulting in an average decrease of processor use.[20]

The contributions of each user are recorded and user contribution statistics are publicly available.[2] Due to the fact that the processing time of each workunit varies from computer to computer depending on the difficulty of the workunit, the speed of the computer and the amount of idle resources available, contributions are usually measured in terms of points. Points are awarded for each workunit depending on the effort required to process that workunit.[21]
Upon completing a workunit, the BOINC client will request the number of points it thinks it deserves based on software benchmarks (see BOINC Credit System#Cobblestones). Since multiple computers process the same workunit to ensure accuracy, the World Community Grid servers can look at the points claimed by each of those computers. The WCG servers disregard statistical outliers, average the remaining values and award the resulting number of points to each computer.[22][23]
Within the grid, users may join teams that have been created by organizations, groups, or individuals. Teams allow for a heightened sense of community identity and can also inspire competition. As teams compete against each other, more work is done for the grid overall.[24]

World Community Grid recognizes companies and organizations as partners if they promote WCG within their company or organization. As of August 25, 2008, WCG had 396 partners. [2]
Also, as part of its commitment to improving human health and welfare, the results of all computations completed on World Community Grid are released into the public domain and made available to the scientific community.[3]
In the fall of 2006, IBM sponsored an online and print advertisement campaign for WCG.[25] Print advertisements appeared in Exceptional Parent, Ability Magazine, Forbes magazine, The Wall Street Journal, The Economist, and Fortune magazine.[26][27]


FightAIDS@Home was World Community Grid's second project and its first to target a single disease. Each individual computer processes one potential drug molecule and tests how well it would dock with HIV protease, acting as a protease inhibitor.[29] Scripps Research Institute published its first peer-reviewed scientific paper about the results of FightAIDS@Home on April 21, 2007.[30] This paper explains that the results up to that point will primarily be used to improve the efficiency of future FightAIDS@Home calculations.[31]

Human Proteome Folding Phase 2 (HPF2) was the third project to run on World Community Grid. This project, following on from HPF1, focuses on human-secreted proteins, with special focus on biomarkers and the proteins on the surface of cells as well as Plasmodium, the organism that causes malaria. HPF2 generates higher-resolution protein models than HPF1. Though these higher-resolution models are more useful, they also require more processing power to generate.[33]

Discovering Dengue Drugs â€“ Together is sponsored by scientists at the University of Texas and the University of Chicago and will run in two phases.[34] Phase 1, launched August 21, 2007,[32] will use AutoDock 2007 (the same software used for FightAIDS@Home) to test potential antiviral drugs (through NS3 protease inhibition) against viruses from the family flaviviridae.[35] Phase 2 "will use a more computationally intensive program to screen the candidates that make it through Phase 1."[36] The drug candidates that make it through Phase 2 will then be lab-tested.[36]

The Help Conquer Cancer project is sponsored by the Ontario Cancer Institute (OCI), Princess Margaret Hospital and University Health Network of Toronto, Canada. The project involves X-ray crystallography.

This research in the field of agronomy is sponsored by the University of Washington's Computational Biology Research Group [3]. The purpose of this project is to predict the structure of proteins of major strains of rice, in order to help farmers breed better rice strains with higher crop yields, promote greater disease and pest resistance, and utilize a full range of bioavailable nutrients that can benefit people around the world, especially in regions where malnutrition is a critical concern.

The mission of the Clean Energy Project is to find new materials for the next generation of solar cells and later, energy storage devices. Researchers are employing molecular mechanics and electronic structure calculations to predict the optical and transport properties of molecules that could become the next generation of solar cell materials. By harnessing the computing power of the World Community Grid, researchers can calculate the electronic properties of tens of thousands of organic materials â€“ many more than could ever be tested in a lab â€“ and determine which candidates are most promising for developing affordable solar energy technology.[37]
