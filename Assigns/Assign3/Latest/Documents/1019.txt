Tim Tam Slam
The Tim Tam Slam is the practice of drinking a beverage by sucking it through a Tim Tam, an Australian chocolate-covered biscuit, with both of the ends bitten off.
Ideally, the inside of the biscuit should collapse but the outside should remain intact. Just before the biscuit falls apart, it is placed in the mouth. The thicker chocolate coating on the Double Coat Tim Tam offers a more stable structure to help ensure that the biscuit does not collapse prematurely - refrigerating them also helps to preserve the outside structure while allowing the inside of the biscuit to melt. The Chewy Caramel variety also has an advantage for performing the TimTam Slam since the caramel centre helps to hold the biscuit together for a slightly longer time. The practice is also known as Shotgunning a Tim Tam, in reference to Shotgunning beer. The Arnott's company prefers the name Tim Tam Suck and ran an advertising campaign promoting it under this name.[1][2]
Equivalent practices are possible with other biscuits. In an article in the The Oberlin Review, Cat Richert reports attempting the practice in the United States using Oreo cookies after returning from a trip to Tasmania, but without success.[3]
A Tim Tam Slam has been performed by Natalie Imbruglia and host Graham Norton on the So Graham Norton television series in the United Kingdom. American actress Jennifer Love Hewitt also performed one live on Rove McManus's Australian talk show Rove Live after professing her love for the biscuit.

On Australia Day in 2004, 200 people in a pub in Croydon, England, and reportedly 30,000 people throughout the United Kingdom as a whole, attempted to set a record for tea-sucking, using Tim Tams.[4]
