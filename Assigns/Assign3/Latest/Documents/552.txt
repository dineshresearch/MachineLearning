List of countries by size of armed forces
This list of countries by size of armed forces displays national troop levels by active troop strength, number of Naval combatants, fighter aircraft and nuclear weapons. The listâ€™s ranking however is based in the number of troops, not in the numbers of tanks, aircraft, ships or power of the armed forces. This list is indicative only, as strict comparisons cannot accurately be made. For example, "troop strength" in some forces might include administrative or paramilitary functions that in another country might be civilian roles and therefore excluded from the below figures.
