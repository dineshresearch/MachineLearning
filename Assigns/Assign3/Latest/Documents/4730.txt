The following is a list of integrals (antiderivative functions) of trigonometric functions. For antiderivatives involving both exponential and trigonometric functions, see List of integrals of exponential functions. For a complete list of antiderivative functions, see lists of integrals. See also trigonometric integral.
In all formulas the constant a is assumed to be nonzero, and C denotes the constant of integration.
