The Louvre Museum (French: Mus√©e du Louvre), located in Paris, is a historic monument, and a national museum of France. It is a central landmark, located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the 1st arrondissement (neighbourhood). Nearly 35,000†objects from the 6th†millennium BC to the 19th†century AD are exhibited over an area of 60,600 square metres (652,300 square feet).
The museum is housed in the Louvre Palace (Palais du Louvre) which began as a fortress built in the late 12th†century under Philip†II. Remnants of the fortress are still visible. The building was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace. In 1672, Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for his household, leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection, including, from 1692, a collection of antique sculpture.[3] In 1692, the building was occupied by the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres and the Acad√©mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, which in 1699 held the first of a series of salons. The Acad√©mie remained at the Louvre for 100 years.[4] During the French Revolution, the National Assembly decreed that the Louvre should be used as a museum, to display the nation's masterpieces.
The museum opened on 10 August 1793 with an exhibition of 537†paintings, the majority of the works being confiscated church and royal property. Because of structural problems with the building, the museum was closed in 1796 until 1801. The size of the collection increased under Napoleon when the museum was renamed the Mus√©e Napol√©on. After his defeat at Waterloo, many works seized by Napoleon's armies were returned to their original owners. The collection was further increased during the reigns of Louis XVIII and Charles X, and during the Second Empire the museum gained 20,000†pieces. Holdings have grown steadily through donations and gifts since the Third Republic, except during the two World Wars. As of 2008, the collection is divided among eight curatorial departments: Egyptian Antiquities; Near Eastern Antiquities; Greek, Etruscan, and Roman Antiquities; Islamic Art; Sculpture; Decorative Arts; Paintings; and Prints and Drawings.


The Louvre Palace (Palais du Louvre) which houses the museum was begun as a fortress by Philip II in the 12th century, with remnants of this building still visible in the crypt.[5] It is not known if this was the first building on that spot, but it is possible that Philip modified an existing tower.[6] The etymology of the name Louvre is also uncertain: it may refer to the structure's status as the largest in late 12th†century Paris (from the French L'≈íuvre, masterpiece), its location in a forest (from the French rouvre, oak), or, according to Larousse, a wolf-hunting den (via Latin: lupus, lower Empire: lupara).[6][7]
The Louvre Palace was altered frequently throughout the Middle Ages. In the 14th†century, Charles†V converted the building into a residence and in 1546, Francis†I renovated the site in French Renaissance style.[8] Francis acquired what would become the nucleus of the Louvre's holdings, his acquisitions including Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa.[9] After Louis†XIV chose Versailles as his residence in 1682, constructions slowed; however, the move permitted the Louvre to be used as a residence for artists.[8][10][11]
By the mid-18th†century there were an increasing number of proposals to create a public gallery with Lafont Saint-Yenne publishing, in 1747, a call for the royal collection's display.[12] In 1750, Louis XV agreed and sanctioned the display of some of the royal collection in the Louvre. A hall was opened for public viewing on Wednesdays and Saturdays and contained Andrea del Sarto's Charity and works by Raphael.[13] Under Louis XVI, the royal museum idea became policy.[12] The comte d'Angiviller broadened the collection and in 1776 proposed conversion of the Grande Galerie‚Äîwhich contained maps‚Äîinto the "French Museum".[13] Many proposals were offered for the Louvre's renovation into a museum, however none was agreed on. Hence the museum remained incomplete until the French Revolution.[13]

During the French Revolution the Louvre was transformed into a public museum. In May 1791, the Assembly declared that the Louvre would be, "a place for bringing together monuments of all the sciences and arts".[13] On 10 August 1792, Louis†XVI was imprisoned and the royal collection in the Louvre became national property. Because of fear of vandalism or theft, on 19 August, the National Assembly pronounced the museum's preparation as urgent. In October, a committee to "preserve the national memory" began assembling the collection for display.[14]

The museum opened on 10 August 1793, the first anniversary of the monarchy's demise. The public was given free access on three days per week, which was "perceived as a major accomplishment and was generally appreciated".[16] The collection showcased 537†paintings and 184†objects of art. Three quarters were derived from the royal collections, the remainder from confiscated √©migr√©s and Church property (biens nationaux).[17][18] To expand and organize the collection, the Republic dedicated 100,000†livres per year.[13] In 1794, France's revolutionary armies began bringing pieces from across Europe, such as Laoco√∂n and His Sons and the Apollo Belvedere, to establish the Louvre as a museum and as a "sign of popular sovereignty".[17][19]
The early days were hectic; artists lived in residence, and the unlabelled paintings hung "frame to frame from floor to ceiling".[17] The building itself closed in May 1796 because of structural deficiencies. It reopened on 14 July 1801, arranged chronologically and with new lighting and columns.[17]

Under Napoleon I, a northern wing paralleling the Grande Galerie was begun, and the collection grew through successful military campaigns.[20] Following the Egyptian campaign of 1798‚Äì1801, Napol√©on appointed the museum's first director, Dominique Vivant Denon. In tribute, the museum was renamed the "Mus√©e Napol√©on" in 1803, and Spanish, Austrian, Dutch, and Italian works were acquired as spoils.[21] After the French defeat at Waterloo, the former owners sought their return. The Louvre's administrators were loath to comply and hid many works in their private collections. In response, foreign states sent emissaries to London to seek help, and many pieces were returned, even some that had been restored by the Louvre.[21][22]

During the Restoration (1814‚Äì30), Louis†XVIII and Charles†X between them added 135†pieces at a cost of 720,000†francs. This was less than the amount given for rehabilitation of Versailles, and the Louvre suffered relative to the rest of Paris. After the creation of the French Second Republic in 1848, the new government allocated two†million francs for repair work and ordered the completion of the Galerie d'Apollon, the Salon Carr√©, and the Grande Galerie.[23] On 2 December 1851, President Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte staged a coup d'√©tat, ushering in the Second French Empire. Between 1852 and 1870, the French economy grew; the museum added 20,000†new pieces to its collections, and the Pavillon de Flore and the Grande Galerie were remodelled under architects Louis Visconti and Hector Lefuel.[23]

During the French Third Republic the Louvre acquired new pieces mainly via donations and gifts. The Soci√©t√© des Amis du Louvre donated the Piet√† of Villeneuve-l√®s-Avignon, and in 1863 an expedition uncovered the sculpture Winged Victory of Samothrace in the Aegean Sea. This piece, though heavily damaged, has been prominently displayed since 1884.[24] More than 7,000†works arrived after the acquisition of the Campana, Durand, Salt, and Drovetti collections. The 389†item Collection Lacaze, included Rembrandts, such as Bathsheba at Her Bath.[24]
Museum expansion slowed after World War I, and the collection did not acquire many significant new works; exceptions were Georges de La Tour's Saint Thomas and Baron Edmond de Rothschild's (1845‚Äì1934) 1935 donation of 4,000†engravings, 3,000†drawings, and 500†illustrated books.[18] During World War II the museum removed most of the art and hid valuable pieces. On 27 August 1939, after two days of packing, truck convoys began to leave Paris. By 28 December, the museum was cleared of most works, except those that were too heavy and "unimportant paintings [that] were left in the basement".[25] In early 1945, after the liberation of France, art began returning to the Louvre.[26]

The Mus√©e du Louvre contains more than 380,000†objects and displays 35,000†works of art in eight curatorial departments with more than 60,600†square metres (652,000†sq†ft) dedicated to the permanent collection.[27] The Louvre exhibits sculptures, objets d'art, paintings, drawings, and archaeological finds.[18] It is the world's most visited museum, averaging 15,000†visitors per day, 65†percent of whom are tourists.[28][29] In popular culture, the Louvre was a point of interest in the book The Da Vinci Code and the 2006 film based on the book. The museum earned $2.5†million by allowing filming in its galleries.[30][31]

The Louvre is owned by the French government; however, since the nineties it has become more independent.[28][32][33][34] Since 2003, the museum has been required to generate funds for projects.[33] By 2006, government funds had dipped from 75†percent of the total budget to 62†percent. In 2008, the French government provided $180†million of the Louvre's yearly $350†million budget; the remainder came from private contributions and ticket sales.[32]
The Louvre employs a staff of 2,000 led by Director Henri Loyrette, who reports to the French Ministry of Culture and Communications. Under Loyrette, who replaced Pierre Rosenberg in 2001, the Louvre has undergone policy changes that allow it to lend and borrow more work than before.[28][33] In 2006, it loaned 1,300†works, which enabled it to borrow more foreign works. From 2006 to 2009, the Louvre will lend artwork to the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia, and will receive a $6.9†million payment to be used for renovations.[33] In addition, the opening of the Louvre Abu Dhabi generated further income for the museum. Loyrette has tried to improve weak parts of the collection through income generated from loans of art and by guaranteeing that "20% of admissions receipts will be taken annually for acquisitions".[33] He has more administrative independence for the museum and achieved 90†percent of galleries to be open daily, as opposed to 80†percent previously. He oversaw the creation of extended hours and free admission on Friday nights and an increase in the acquisition budget to $36†million from $4.5†million.[32][33]

The Louvre Palace is an almost rectangular structure, composed of the square Cour Carr√©e and two wings which wrap the Cour Napol√©on to the north and south. In the heart of the complex is the Louvre Pyramid, above the visitor's center. The museum is divided into three wings: the Sully Wing to the east, which contains the Cour Carr√©e and the oldest parts of the Louvre; the Richelieu Wing to the north; and the Denon Wing, which borders the Seine to the south.[35]
In 1983, French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand proposed the Grand Louvre plan to renovate the building and relocate the Finance Ministry, allowing displays throughout the building. Architect I. M. Pei was awarded the project and proposed a glass pyramid for the central courtyard.[36] The pyramid and its underground lobby were inaugurated on 15 October 1988. The second phase of the Grand Louvre plan, La Pyramide Invers√©e (The Inverted Pyramid), was completed in 1993. As of 2002, attendance had doubled since completion.[29]

The Mus√©e du Louvre contains more than 380,000†objects and displays 35,000†works of art in eight curatorial departments.[38]

The department, comprising over 50,000†pieces,[39] includes artifacts from the Nile civilizations which date from 4,000†BCE to the 4th†century†CE.[40] The collection, among the world's largest, overviews Egyptian life spanning Ancient Egypt, the Middle Kingdom, the New Kingdom, Coptic art, and the Roman, Ptolemaic, and Byzantine periods.[40] The department's origins lie in the royal collection, but it was augmented by Napoleon's 1798 expeditionary trip with Dominique Vivant, the future director of the Louvre.[39] After Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion translated the Rosetta Stone, Charles†X decreed that an Egyptian Antiquities department be created. Champollion advised the purchase of three collections, t
