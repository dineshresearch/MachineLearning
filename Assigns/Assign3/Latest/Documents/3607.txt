Intellectual capital
Intellectual capital is a term with various definitions in different theories of management and economics. Accordingly, its only truly neutral definition is as a debate over economic "intangibles". Ambiguous combinations of human capital, instructional capital and individual capital employed in productive enterprise are usually what is meant by the term, when it is used to actually refer to a capital asset whose yield is intellectual property rights.
