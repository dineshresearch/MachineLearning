HD Radio
HD Radio technology is a system used by AM and FM radio stations to digitally transmit audio and data in conjunction with their analog signals. This system enables AM and FM radio stations to simulcast both digital and analog audio within the same channel (a hybridized digital-analog signal) as well as add new FM channels and text information. Although HD Radio broadcasting's content is currently subscription-free, listeners must purchase new receivers in order to receive the digital portion of the signal. As of March 2009, 1,879 stations covering approximately 84% of the United States[1] are broadcasting with this technology plus more than 1,000 HD2/3 multicast channels are on the air.[1]
"HD Radio" is the trademark for iBiquity's in-band on-channel (IBOC) technology, which was selected by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2002 as a digital audio broadcasting method for the United States.[2][3] According to iBiquity's website, the "HD" is simply a brand name and has no meaning, although their earlier whitepaper documents refer to "Hybrid Digital" radio technology and operating modes.[4]. There is no connection with high-definition television (HDTV), although like HDTV the HD Radio specification provides enhanced capabilities over the old analog format, such as 5.1 surround sound.
The HD Radio system, the only digital system approved by the FCC for digital AM/FM broadcasts in the United States, is officially known as NRSC-5, with the latest version being NRSC-5B.[5] Other digital radio systems include FMeXtra, Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM+), and Compatible AM-Digital (CAM-D).
The FCC has not indicated any intent to force off analog radio broadcasts as it has with analog television broadcasts [2], as it would not result in the recovery of any radio spectrum rights which could be sold. Thus, there is no deadline by which consumers must buy an HD Radio receiver.

Digital information is transmitted using COFDM with an audio compression algorithm called HDC (which does not mean high-definition, according to iBiquity Digital the patent holder of the codec) with spectral band replication (SBR). (HDC is a proprietary codec based upon but incompatible with the MPEG-4 standard HE-AAC). HD Radio equipped stations pay a one-time licensing fee for iBiquity's patents, software, and trademarks.[6] The cost of converting a radio station can run between $100,000 and $200,000. [7] Receiver manufacturers pay a royalty.[8]
If digital signal reception is lost, the HD Radio receiver will revert to the analog signal, thereby providing seamless operation between the newer and older transmission methods. Alternatively the HD Radio can revert to a more-robust ~20 kilobit per second stream. Datacasting is also possible, with metadata providing song titles or artist information.
iBiquity Digital claims that the system approaches CD quality sound and offers reduction of both interference and static;[9] however, some listeners have complained of increased interference on the AM band (see AM, below).

Sending pure digital data through the approximately 20 kilohertz AM channel is roughly equivalent to sending data through two 33 kbit/s analog telephone lines, thus limiting the maximum throughput possible. By using spectral band replication the HDC+SBR codec is able to recreate sounds up to 15,000 Hz, thus achieving FM quality on the bandwidth-tight AM band.[10] The HD Radio AM hybrid mode offers two options which can carry approximately 40 or 60 kbit/s of data, but most AM digital stations default to the more-robust 40 kbit/s mode which features redundancy (same signal broadcast twice). HD Radio also provides a pure digital mode, which lacks an analog signal for fallback and instead reverts to a 20 kbit/s signal during times of poor reception. The pure digital mode transmissions will stay within the AM stations channel instead of spilling into the channels next to the station transmitting "HD radio".
The AM version of HD Radio technology uses the 20 kHz channel, and overlaps 5 kHz (halfway) into the adjacent channel on both sides. When operating in pure digital mode, the AM HD Radio signal fits inside a standard 20 kHz channel (20-40 kbit/s) or an extended 30 kHz channel (40-60 kbit/s), at the discretion of the station manager. As AM radio stations are spaced at 9 kHz (Europe) or 10 kHz (Americas) intervals, much of the digital information overlaps adjacent channels when in hybrid mode. Some nighttime listeners have expressed concern this design harms reception of adjacent channels [11][12] with one formal complaint filed regarding the matter: WYSL owner Bob Savage against WBZ in Boston. The digital radio signal received on a conventional AM receiver tuned to an adjacent channel sounds like a large waterfall or similar white noise-like hiss, as can be heard in the audio soundclip referenced in the previous sentence. However, this sort of signal, at low levels, creates less annoying interference than other types of signal transmission methods.[citation needed]

The FM hybrid digital/analog mode offers four options which can carry approximately 100, 112, 125, or 150 kbit/s of lossy data depending upon the Station Manager's power budget and/or desired range of signal. The HD Radio also provides several pure digital modes with up to 300 kbit/s bitrate, and enabling extra features like surround sound. Like AM, pure digital FM provides a "fall back" condition where it reverts to a more-robust 25 kbit/s signal.
FM stations have the option to subdivide their datastream into sub-channels (FM97-HD1, -HD2, -HD3) of varying audio quality. The multiple services are similar to the digital subchannels found in ATSC-compliant digital television using multiplexed broadcasting. For example, some Top 40 stations have added Hot AC and Classic rock to their sub-channels to provide more variety to listeners.[13] Stations may eventually go all-digital, thus allowing as many as three full-power channels and four low-power channels (seven total). As defined by iBiquity these channels could be sub-divided into CD-quality (100 kbit/s), FM-quality (25-50 kbit/s), AM-quality (12 kbit/s), or Talk-quality (5 kbit/s) channels. Alternatively, they could broadcast one single channel at 300 kbit/s.
Where the digital signal fails, the analog signal is used as a fallback for the main digital channel (normally HD1), requiring synchronization of the two. Current FCC rules require that one channel be a simulcast of the analog signal.
Stations can transmit HD Radio through their existing antennas using a diplexer as on AM, or are permitted by the FCC to use a separate antenna at the same location.

Currently, FM stations in the United States and Canada are licensed to carry 130 kilohertz of bandwidth, requiring approximately 260 kilohertz of spectrum. Only 15 kHz of the modulation bandwidth is used by analog Monaural audio, with the remainder used for stereo, RBDS, paging, radio reading service, rental to other customers, or as a transmitter-studio link for in-house telemetry.
In regular hybrid mode, a station has its full Â± 130 kHz of analog bandwidth, and adds an extra Â± 70 kHz for its digital signals, thus taking a full 400 kHz of width. FM stations also have the option to discontinue existing subcarrier services (usually at 92 kHz and 67 kHz) in order to carry extended HD Radio, though such services can be restored through use of the digital subchannels that are then made available. However, this requires the replacement of all related equipment both for the broadcasters and all of the receivers that use the discontinued services.
The ratio of power of the analog signal to the digital signal is standardized at 100:1, devoting 1% of the total carrier power to the digital signal. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) is expected to request a 10 dB (10Ã—) increase [14] in the digital signal from the FCC. This equates to an increase to 10% of the total carrier power and a decrease in the analog signal from 99% to 90%. This may reduce analog coverage slightly, but results in a dramatic improvement in digital coverage.
There are still some concerns that HD Radio on FM will increase interference between different stations because HD Radio does not fit within the FCC spectral mask. North American FM channels are spaced 200 kHz apart. An HD Radio station will not generally cause interference to any analog station within its 1 mV/m service contour, the limit above which the FCC protects most stations. However, the IBOC signal resides within the analog signal of the first-adjacent station. With the proposed power increase of 10dB, the potential exists to cause the degradation of analog signals within its 1 mV/m service contour.[15] [16] [17] [18] Ironically, the National Association of Broadcasters claims this is not a problem, while at the same time using it as justification to keep LPFM stations (except its own members' translator stations) off the air.


Some European Union countries have implemented Eureka-147 Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB), with compatible radios having been available since 1999. This system has also been implemented in a limited number of Canadian markets. DAB broadcasts a single station that is approximately 1500 kilohertz in width (~1000 kilobits per second). That station is then subdivided into multiple digital streams of between 9 and 12 programs. In order to implement DAB, it was necessary for the European Telecommunications organization to set aside a new range of frequencies, whereas FM HD Radio shares its digital broadcast with the traditional 200 kilohertz-wide channels, mixing incompatible digital and analog signals into the same spectrum.
In the UK, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland, which are the leading countries with regard to implementing DAB, the first-generation MPEG-1 Audio Layer II (MP2) codec stereo radio stations on DAB have a lower sound-quality than FM, prompting a number of complaints.[19] The typical bandwidth for DAB programs is only 128 kbit/s using the first generation, less-robust MP2 codec which requires at least double that rate to be considered near-CD quality. For comparison, the HD Radio standard assigns up to 300 kbit/s for each individual FM station, using a proprietary iBiquity HDC codec, derived from MPEG-4 HE-AAC, which can provide perceived CD quality as low as 64 kbit/s, or 5.1 surround at higher rates.[20][21] In order to address this flaw the new DAB+ will also use MPEG-4, however this will require all current customers to acquire new DAB+ units.
A directly-related issue with DAB's original inefficient compression is "downgrading" stations from stereophonic to monaural, in order to include more channels into the limited 1000 kbit/s bandwidth,[22] smaller coverage of markets as compared to analog FM, radios that are overly expensive, poor reception inside vehicles or buildings, and a general lack of interest in DAB (only 5 million units sold in the largest take up area of UK by mid-2007).[23] HD Radio shares most of these same flaws (see criticisms below).

The European Union states are in the process of rolling-out Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM), with compatible radios already available for sale. DRM is very similar to AM HD Radio in that each station is broadcast via a channel 20 kilohertz wide (+/-10 kHz), and the radio is hand-tuned to each individual station's location on the dial. The two standards also share the same modulation scheme (COFDM), codecs based upon MPEG-4 AAC, and like HD Radio DRM allows broadcasters multiple options:
Actual DRM bit rates vary depending on day versus night transmission (groundwave versus skywave) and desired robustness. For AM stations DRM offers a growth path for broadcasters. Unfortunately DRM shares many of the same flaws as DAB and HD Radio technology: Shorter broadcast distance as compared to analog AM signal when in hybrid mode; poor reception inside vehicles and buildings; and interference with adjacent channels (though in all-digital mode the signal fits inside the designated channel mask).


There is low awareness among consumers, and even lower uptake. According to a survey dated August 8, 2007 by Bridge Ratings, when asked the question, "Would you buy an HD radio in the next two months?" only 1.0% responded "yes".[24] Some broadcast engineers have also expressed distrust or dislike of the new system.[25][26] Also, a survey conducted in September 2008 saw a small percentage still confused HD radio with satellite radio.[27]
Most of the first-generation HD Radio tuners have been noted as being very insensitive, making reception problematic. The HD Radio signal is 20 dBW below (one percent the power of) a station's analog signal. In addition it has been noted that the analog section of some tuners displays poor reception capabilities compared to older non-digital models.[28]

Even though DAB and DRM standards are open-standards and pre-date HD-Radio, HD-Radios cannot be used to receive these stations when sold or moved overseas. The HD Radio system is a different digital broadcasting standard than those previously adopted in other countries. The lack of a common standard means that HD Radios cannot receive DAB format broadcasts of other countries and vice-versa, and that manufacturers must develop separate products for different countries, which typically are not dual-format. Whereas the AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) family of codecs are publicly documented standards, the HDC codec exists only within the HD Radio system, and is an iBiquity trade secret. Similarly DRM and DAB are open specifications, while iBiquity's HD Radio specification is partly open but mostly private.[29]

Promotion for HD Radio does not always make clear that some of its capabilities are mutually incompatible with other of its capabilities. For example, the FM system has been described as "CD quality;" however, the FM system also allows multiplexing the data stream between two or more separate programs. A program utilizing one half or less of the data stream does not attain the higher audio quality of a single program allowed the full data stream. The FCC has declared "one free over-the-air digital stream [must be] of equal or greater quality than the stationâ€™s existing analog signal".[30] (If the FCC discontinues analog simulcasting, each station will have over 300 kbit/s bandwidth available, allowing for CD or even Surround Sound-quality audio together with multiple sub-channels.)
Another such conflict arises from the extra "free" programs available today. The broadcasting industry is seeking FCC approval for conditional access, that is, enabling the extra programs to be available only by paid subscription (on future models of HD Radio). Conditional access will also enable special services for the blind (such as radio reading services) and hearing impaired.[31] NDS, a maker of digital media encryption technology, has a deal with iBiquity to provide HD Radio with an encrypted content-delivery system called RadioGuard.[32] NDS claims that RadioGuard will "provide additional revenue-generating possibilities".

Radio stations are licensed in the United States to broadcast at a specific effective radiated power level. Adding HD Radio technology reduces the amount of power available for the analog portion to 99%, to make room for the 1% level digital broadcast. NPR Labs recently did a study of predicted HD radio operation if power levels were increased to 10% of maximum power, and found the digital signal would increase RF interference on FM. However the boosted digital HD signal coverage would then exceed analog coverage, with 17% more population covered.[33]

The costs of installing the proprietary system, including a one-time license fee, prohibits all but the most well-off public radio (NCE) stations from installing the system. Large companies in larger media markets (such as Clear Channel or Citadel Broadcasting) can afford to implement the technology for their stations. Current HD Radio receivers cost anywhere from around 50 to several hundred dollars (US), compared to regular FM radios which can even be found at dollar stores. By contrast, all of the R&D work for DAB (and much of DAB+) had already been done, and requires no licensing fees, thus the entire DAB system is cheaper for broadcasters and listeners. FMeXtra is even less expensive, and requires no installation labor or cost for the broadcaster, other than plugging it into the transmitter. It also requires no FCC approval, coming under a station's subsidiary communications authority. However, other digital broadcast technologies have not been approved for use in the United States, leaving no alternative.

Currently the HD Digital Radio Alliance, a consortium of major owners such as ABC, CBS, and ClearChannel, is acting as a liaison for stations to choose unduplicated formats for the extra channels (HD2, HD3, etc.). This is designed to provide additional choices for listeners instead of several stations all independently deciding to create the same format. HD1 stations broadcast the same format as the regular FM (and some AM) stations, and most of these stations offer an HD2 subchannel to complement their current programming.
Clear Channel is selling programming of several different music genres to other competing stations, in addition to airing them on its own stations. Some stations are simulcasting their local AM or lower-power FM broadcasts on sister stations' HD2 channels. It is common practice to broadcast an older, discontinued format on HD2 channels, such as WPGB in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania which carries its former smooth jazz format on its HD2 band. Other recent additions include introduction of air staff on HD2 stations, like KDWB's Party Zone channel in Minneapolis-Saint Paul. Some HD2 or HD3 stations are even simulcasting sister AM stations, such as KTMY in Centerville, Utah simulcasting sister station KNRS 570. KBCO in Boulder, Colorado uses it's HD2 channel to broadcast exclusive live recordings from their private recording studio.

Although broadcast translators are prohibited from originating their own programming, the FCC has allowed stations to ignore this by having their programming simulcast on an HD Radio channel of the primary station the translator is assigned to. This also allows station owners, who already usually own multiple stations locally and nationally, to circumvent the rulemaking process of changing the table of allotments to get a new station, and to avoid ownership caps intended to prevent the excessive concentration of media ownership. These also block new LPFM stations from going on the air, and are allowed much greater broadcast range (height and power) than locally-originated LPFMs.
For translators used for their original intent (to retransmit the primary station unmodified to distant areas with poor reception), HD Radio may be passed along from the main station via a "bent pipe" setup, where the translator simply makes a frequency shift of the entire channel, often with an intermediate frequency. Translators which use a separate receiver and transmitter also require a separate HD Radio transmitter, just as the main station. Translators are not required to pass-through HD Radio at all.


Receivers are becoming less expensive, starting at around US$100. Manufacturers have initially focused on making car stereos. In 2008, Ford Motor Company became the first U.S. automaker to feature HD Radio tuners in its vehicles; and beginning with the 2009 model year, Ford will offer HD Radio tuners as a factory-installed option (Compatible with
