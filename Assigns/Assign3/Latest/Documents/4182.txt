Reggaeton
Reggaeton (IPA:†[…π…õ ge…™ Ààto än]) (also spelled reggaet√≥n, and known as reguet√≥n and reggaet√≥n in Spanish) is a form of urban music that became popular with Latin American youth in the early 1990s. After its mainstream exposure in 2004, it spread to North American, European and Asian audiences. Originating in Panama, reggaeton blends West-Indian music influences of reggae and dancehall with those of Latin America, such as bomba, plena, salsa, merengue, latin pop, cumbia and bachata as well as that of hip hop, contemporary R&B, and electronica. However, reggaeton is also combined with rapping or singing in Spanish. The influence of this genre has spread to the wider Latino communities in the United States, as well as the Latin American audience. While it takes influences from hip hop and Jamaican dancehall, it would be wrong to define reggaeton as the Hispanic or Latino version of either of these genres; reggaeton has its own specific beat and rhythm, whereas Latino hip hop is simply hip hop recorded by artists of Latino descent. The specific rhythm that characterizes reggaeton is referred to as "Dem Bow."[1][2] The name is a reference to the title of the dancehall song by Shabba Ranks that first popularized the beat in the early 1990s. Reggaeton's origins represents a hybrid of many different musical genres and influences from various countries in the Caribbean, Latin America and the United States. The genre of reggaeton however is most closely associated with Puerto Rico, as this is where the musical style later popularized and became most famous, and where the vast majority of its current stars originated. [3][4][5][6]
Reggaeton lyrics tend to be more derived from hip hop than dancehall. Like hip hop, reggaeton has caused some controversy, albeit less, due to alleged exploitation of women [7], and to a lesser extent, explicit and violent lyrics. Further controversy surrounds perreo, a dance with explicit sexual overtones which is performed to reggaeton music. Perreo was the subject of a national controversy in Puerto Rico as reggaeton music and the predominantly lower class culture it derived from, became more popular and widely available.

Reggaeton's roots started off as Spanish reggae in Panama.[7][8][3] The music eventually made its way and continued evolving and coming to prominence in Puerto Rico where it became reggaeton. Reggaeton started as an adaptation of Jamaican reggae (and later Jamaican dancehall) to the Spanish language and overall culture in Panama [2].
The origins of reggaeton begin with the first reggae recordings being made in Panama during the late 1970s. Reportedly, the Jamaican influence on Panamanian music has been strong since the early 20th century when Jamaican laborers were used to help build the Panama Canal. [2] Afro-Panamanians had been performing and recording Spanish-language reggae since the 1970s. Artists such as El General, Chicho Man, Nando Boom, Renato, and Black Apache are considered the first raggamuffin DJs from Panama. El General is often considered as the father of reggaeton, blending Jamaican reggae into a Latin-ised version[9][10]. It was common practice to translate the lyrics of Jamaican reggae song into Spanish and sing them over the original melodies, a form termed "Spanish reggae" or "Reggae en espa√±ol." Meanwhile, during the 1980s the Puerto Rican rapper Vico C released Spanish-language hip hop records in his native island. His production of cassettes throughout the 1980s, mixing reggae and hip hop, also helped spread the early reggaeton sound, and he is widely credited with this achievement [11]. The widespread movement of "Spanish reggae" in the Latin-American communities of the Caribbean and the urban centres of the United States help increase its popularity [2].
Meanwhile hip hop and reggae in Puerto Rico were on the rise due to the increased popularity of Jamaican ragga imports. Towards the middle of the decade, Puerto Ricans were producing their own "riddims" with clear influences from hip hop and other styles. These are considered the first proper reggaeton tracks, initially called "under," a short form of "Underground." As Caribbean and African-American music gained this momentum in Puerto Rico, Reggae Rap in Spanish marked the beginning of Boricua underground rap and served as an expression for millions of young people. This created an entire invisible, yet prominent underground youth culture that sought to express themselves through Reggae Rap in Spanish. As a youth culture that exists on the fringes of society and criminal illegality, it has often been publicly criticized. The Puerto Rican police launched a raid against underground rap by confiscating cassette tapes from music stores under Penal codes of obscenity, issuing fines, and the demoralization of rappers through radio, television, and newspaper media. [12]
The term "underground", coming out of hip hop discourse, associates underground artists as asserting a self-identification that rejects the commercialization of music. In San Juan "underground", however, it was not just about authenticity or ideology, but was literally about position in the market. "Underground" music was circulated via informal networks, copied from cassette to cassette, until the mid 1990s.
DJ Playero was one of the most famous producers of "Underground" at the time, releasing several underground cassettes that featured early performances of some soon-to-be-famous artists like Daddy Yankee.
The basis for reggaeton was laid in Puerto Rico at this time, with the melding of Panamanian Spanish reggae, with influences from dancehall, hip hop and various other Latin American musical genres [2].
The genre morphed through the years, at various points being termed "Melaza," "m√∫sica underground," and "Dem Bow." This last name originated from reggaeton's distinguishing rhythmic feature: the Dem Bow (alternately spelled "Dembow") beat, relying heavily on the snare drum, which is used in nearly all reggaeton songs today. [1] [2] This beat, or riddim, was produced under the direction of Jamaican record producer Bobby "Digital" Dixon and performed by Steely & Clevie. It first became popular in the song "Dem Bow" (They Bow) performed by Jamaican dancehall artist Shabba Ranks in 1991.[13] The song and beat achieved greater popularity among Spanish-speaking Latin Americans when Panamanian artist El General released the song "Son Bow" in 1991, a Spanish language cover of "Dem Bow" using the same musical track.[14]. It should be pointed out that neither Shabba or El General sang reggaeton as neither the genre nor its title were as yet formed. Additionally "Dem Bow" was just a single song in Shabba's catalog, with Ranks not singing another significant song using the "Dem Bow" beat. However the influence of the original Bobby Digital beat is undeniable, and modern reggaeton often still reflects the original instrumentation, as well as the original rhythmic structure.
Reggaeton's popularity in the U.S. may also owe some credit to popular Latin Rap artists such as Mellow Man Ace (who produced "Mentirosa", the first platinum single by a Latin rapper, in 1989) or even Gerardo with his Latin hip hop hit "Rico Suave", a top 40 in the U.S. in 1991.

The name reggaeton only gained prominence in the mid-1990s (from the 1994 to 1995 period), with the Dem Bow beat characterizing the genre; this is in contrast to the more reggae, dancehall and hip hop-derived tracks previously created. The name was created in Puerto Rico to signify the hybrid sound, and distinguish it from the previous Spanish reggae, created from the years of mixing the different genres.[2] Today, the music flourishes throughout Latin America.
Reggaeton soon increased in popularity with Latino youth in the United States when DJ Blass worked with artists such as Plan B and Speedy in albums such as Reggaeton Sex.
Reggaeton expanded and became known when other producers followed the steps of DJ Playero, like DJ Nelson and DJ Eric. In the early '90s albums like DJ Playero's Playero 37 (in which Daddy Yankee became known) and The Noise: Underground, The Noise 5 and The Noise 6 were very popular in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Singers like Don Chezina, Master Joe & O.G. Black, Baby Rasta & Gringo, and Lito & Polaco among others were very popular.
Many now popular producers, such as Luny Tunes, Noriega and Eliel, first appeared in the reggaeton scene in 2003. Albums such as Mas Flow, The Last Don, and Las Gargolas 4 expanded reggaeton's popularity among Latinos in the United States.

2004 was the year that reggaeton gained widespread popularity in the United States and non-Hispanic Europe. Tego Calderon was already getting some airplay in the U.S. and it was very popular in the youth market. Daddy Yankee's "El Cangri.com" became popular that year in the U.S., as did Hector Y Tito. Luny Tunes y Noriega's Mas Flow was well received and Kilates, La Mision, Yaga y Mackie with Sonando Differente, Tego Calderon with El Abayarde, Los Homerunes De Yankee, Desafio, Motivando a La Yal By Zion y Lennox, La Conspiracion, and others were popular as well. Then in 2004 rapper N.O.R.E released his hit single "Oye Mi Canto" which seemingly broke cultural and language barriers, which featured the likes of Nina Sky & Daddy Yankee. Soon after Daddy Yankee came out with his album "Barrio Fino" and his hit single "Gasolina" which spread around the world becoming a mega-hit and with it introducing reggaeton to the rest of the world. Tego Calderon also increased the reggaeton genre with singles like "Pa Que Retozen" and "Guasa Guasa". Another important artist who contributed to reggaeton's increasing popularity, especially in Europe, is Don Omar, with singles like "Pobre Diabla" and "Dale Don Dale."[15] Other very popular reggaeton artists include Alexis & Fido, Angel & Khriz, Nina Sky, Nicky Jam, Zion, RKM & Ken-Y, Voltio, Calle 13, H√©ctor "El Father", Ivy Queen, Wisin & Yandel, and Tito "El Bambino".

In May 2006 Don Omar's album, King of Kings, became history's highest ranking reggaeton LP in the top 10 US charts, with its debut at #1 on the Top Latin Albums chart and it's peak at #7 on the Billboard's 200 albums. It also gained the #1 spot on the Billboard Latin Rhythm Radio Chart with the single "Angelito."[16] Don Omar was also able to beat the in-store appearance sales record at Downtown Disney's Virgin music store previously set by pop star Britney Spears, further demonstrating reggaeton's massive rise to popularity in the United States. 2007 also saw new records set demonstrating the immense popularity of reggaeton with Daddy Yankee's June release of El Cartel III: The Big Boss setting the new record for highest first week selling reggaeton album with 88,000 copies sold.[17] It peaked at #1 on both the Top Latin Albums and Top Rap Albums charts. It also peaked at #9 on the Billboard 200.[18] Wisin Y Yandel's album Wisin vs. Yandel: Los Extraterrestres debuted at #14 on the Billboard 200 and #1 on the Top Latin Albums chart.[19] The Daddy Yankee soundtrack to his movie of the same name Talento de Barrio debuting at #13 on the Billboard 200, and also peaked at #1 on the Top Latin Albums chart, #3 on Billboard's Top Soundtracks and #6 on the Top Rap Albums chart.[20].


Reggaeton's most notably unique feature is a driving drum-machine track which was derived from a popular Jamaican dancehall rhythm. As stated previously this beat is called "Dem Bow," from the Bobby Dixon-produced Shabba Ranks song of the same title. The beat that can be heard throughout reggaeton is an interplay of a steady kick drum and a syncopated snare. The kick drum emphasizes a 4/4 beat, while the snare comes on the "and" of the 3rd 8th note and right on the 4th 8th note (or, counting four 16th notes per bass note, on the 4th and 7th 16th notes, in a repeating two-bar pattern). This makes the powerful "boom-ch-boom-chick" sound. It is also typically 95 beats per minute. Many of the sounds found in a typical reggaeton beat are electronically synthesized. Simple melodies may be produced with keyboards, electric guitars, and other electronic instruments. Other forms of electronic dance music have significantly influenced reggaeton beats, such as techno, house, and genres such as the merengue hip hop (also called merenhouse) of groups such as Proyecto Uno.
Reggaeton beats are highly versatile. The great variety and flexibility of reggaeton beats can be illustrated by Luny Tunes' CD The Kings of the Beats, which is a collection of purely instrumental beats. Reggaeton beats can be based on merengue, bachata, bolero, salsa and hip hop beats. Other subgenres of reggaeton include Romantikeo, Bachateo and Salsaton.

Reggaeton bears many resemblances to hip hop. The most notable resemblance to hip hop is that reggaeton, in most cases, is rapped instead of being sung. Reggaeton also has hooks throughout a song that may include a chorus of singers. Reggaeton artists also adopt pseudonyms comparable to those of hip hop artists. Overall, reggaeton and hip hop are both thought of as street-styled music popular among urban youth. Reggaeton also features "beef"-like rivalries similar to those found in hip hop called "tiraera" (literally "throwing" in Puerto Rican Spanish).
Despite the similarities, reggaeton only roughly fits into the Latin hip hop category but is not synonymous with hip hop. True Latin hip hop has beats that almost exactly resemble mainstream hip hop beats. These "hardcore" Latin hip hop artists include Big Pun, Cuban Link, Akwid, and Jae-P. Reggaeton, though, has rap-styled lyrics but has a very different beat that is influenced not by hip hop, but by reggae, dancehall, merengue and techno. Although reggaeton has been influenced by hip hop, it has also borrowed features from many other genres as well and is not considered to be Latin hip hop.
Reggaeton and hip hop are often remixed together, and reggaeton songs and live concerts may feature hip hop artists such as Lil Jon, 50 Cent, and Eminem. Hip hop songs such as Usher's Yeah and Snoop Dogg's Drop It Like It's Hot have been remixed by replacing the original beat with a reggaeton beat. In other remixes, reggaeton DJs may rap out an English song in Spanish.
As reggaeton has gained popularity, there is a new trend of hip hop and reggaeton artists collaborating on songs. Snoop Dogg was featured on Daddy Yankee's Gangsta Zone in his album Barrio Fino En Directo†; as was Paul Wall on remix to Yankee's earlier hit song entitled "Machete." The remix of Daddy Yankee's song Rompe featured Lloyd Banks and Young Buck of G-Unit. And Yankee's first U.S. hit Gasolina was remixed, adding Miami rapper Pitbull, and Crunk music producer Lil Jon to the track. Sean Paul collaborated with him on the song 'Oh Man' on his most recent album, The Trinity. Hip hop producer Pharrell produced and sang on the track 'Mamacita' with Daddy Yankee as well. American rapper Juelz Santana was featured on Don Omar's song Conteo on Omar's album King of Kings which was featured in the movie The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Luny Tunes produced the R.Kelly song 'Burn It Up' with Wisin & Yandel on his album TP3 Reloaded as well as producing the remix to Paris Hilton's song Stars are Blind again featuring Wisin & Yandel, which has sold over 300,000 songs on iTunes. Popular reggaeton producer H√©ctor "El Father" produced the hit song 'Here We Go Yo' with Jay-Z, whom he collaborated with to produce his most recent album "Los Rompe Discotekas" (The Club Bangers) which came out in early summer 2006. Reggaeton artist Voltio raps alongside with R&B group Jagged Edge on the song 'So Amazing'. The song 'Wanna Ride' was recited and sung by distinguished reggaeton artists Wisin & Yandel together with veteran rap group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, and which was featured in the movie Take the Lead starring Antonio Banderas. A remix of the song 'Rakata' by Wisin & Yandel features rapper Ja Rule. The official "Chosen Few" remix to the song "Hello Mama" by Hector "El Father" features American rapper Jim Jones. Both genres are accepting influences from each other today as these musical blends also signify a cultural blending pot in today's urban scene.

Reggaeton lyrical structure resembles hip hop lyrics. Like hip hop, most reggaeton artists recite their lyrics rap-fashion rather than sing it melodically, although earlier reggaeton songs were toasted in which some are
