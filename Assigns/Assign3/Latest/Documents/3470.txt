Curling
Curling is a team sport with similarities to bowls and shuffleboard, played by two teams of four players each on a rectangular sheet of carefully prepared ice. Teams take turns sliding heavy, polished granite stones down the ice towards the target (called the house). Two sweepers with brooms accompany each rock and use timing equipment and their best judgment, along with direction from their teammates, to help direct the stones to their resting place. The complex nature of stone placement and shot selection has led some to refer to curling as "chess on ice."[1]

The game of curling is thought to have been invented in late medieval Scotland, with the first written reference to a contest using stones on ice coming from the records of Paisley Abbey, Renfrewshire, in February 1541. Two paintings (both dated 1565) by Pieter Bruegel the Elder depict Dutch peasants curlingâ€”Scotland and the Low Countries had strong trading and cultural links during this period, which is also evident in the history of golf.
The game of curling was already in existence in Scotland in the early 16th century, as evidenced by a curling stone inscribed with the date 1511 (uncovered along with another bearing the date 1551) when an old pond was drained at Dunblane, Scotland. Kilsyth Curling Club claims to be the first club in the world, having been formally constituted in 1716; it is still in existence today[2]. Kilsyth also claims the oldest purpose-built curling pond in the world at Colzium, in the form of a low dam creating a shallow pool some 100 Ã— 250 metres in size, though this is now very seldom in condition for curling due to warmer winters.
The word curling first appears in print in 1620 in Perth, in the preface and the verses of a poem by Henry Adamson. The game was (and still is, in Scotland and Scottish-settled regions like southern New Zealand) also known as "the roaring game" because of the sound the stones make while traveling over the pebble (droplets of water applied to the playing surface). The verbal noun curling is formed from the Scots (and English) verb curl[3] which describes the motion of the stone.
In the early history of curling, the rocks were simply flat-bottomed river stones that were sometimes notched or shaped; the thrower had little control over the rock, and relied more on luck than skill to win, unlike today's reliance on skill and strategy.
It is recorded that in Darvel, East Ayrshire, the weavers relaxed by playing curling matches. The stones they used were the heavy stone weights from the weavers' "warp beams," fitted with a detachable handle for the purpose. Many a wife would keep her husband's brass curling stone handle on the mantelpiece, brightly polished until the next time it was needed.[4]
Outdoor curling was very popular in Scotland between the 16th and 19th centuries, as the climate provided good ice conditions every winter. Scotland is home to the international governing body for curling, the World Curling Federation, Perth, which originated as a committee of the Royal Caledonian Curling Club, the mother club of curling. Today, the game is most firmly established in Canada, having been taken there by Scottish emigrants. The Royal Montreal Curling Club, the oldest active athletic club of any kind in North America[citation needed], was established in 1807. The first curling club in the United States began in 1830, and the game was introduced to Switzerland and Sweden before the end of the 19th century, also by Scots. Today, curling is played all over Europe and has spread to Japan, Australia, New Zealand, China, and Korea.
The first world curling championship in the sport was limited to men and was known as the "Scotch Cup," held in Falkirk and Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1959. The first world title was won by the Canadian team from Regina, Saskatchewan, skipped by Ernie Richardson. (The skip is the team member who calls the shots; see below.)
The first curling club in the United States was organized in 1830 only thirty miles from Detroit, at Orchard Lake, Michigan. Called the Orchard Lake Curling Club, the club used hickory block "stones." The Detroit Curling Club was started back in 1840 when Michigan only had a population of 212,000 and had only been in the Union for three years. About this time, an organization called the "Thistle Club" was founded and, curling being a winter sport, was played when the ice was suitable on the Detroit River at the foot of Joseph Campau; on the bay; and at the old Recreation Park. These clubs became the Granite Club, and in 1885, the present Detroit Curling Club was organized.

Curling has been an official sport in the Winter Olympic Games since the 1998 Winter Olympics. In February 2006, the International Olympic Committee retroactively decided that the curling competition from the 1924 Winter Olympics (originally called Semaine des Sports d'Hiver, or International Winter Sports Week) would be considered official Olympic events and no longer be considered demonstration events. Thus, the first Olympic medals in curling, which at the time was played outside, were awarded for the 1924 Winter Games, with the gold medal won by Great Britain and Ireland, two silver medals by Sweden, and the bronze by France. A demonstration tournament was also held during the 1932 Winter Olympic Games between four teams from Canada and four teams from the United States, with Canada winning 12 games to 4.[5][6]

The curling sheet, by World Curling Federation standards, is an area of ice 146 to 150 feet (45 to 46 m) in length by 14 feet 6 inches (4.4 m) to 16 feet 5 inches (5.0 m) in width,[7] carefully prepared to be as close to level as possible. The ice is most often frozen by means of a refrigeration plant that cools a brine solution running lengthwise in numerous pipes under the curling sheet. A key part of the preparation of the playing surface is the spraying of water droplets, called "pebble," onto the level ice. Due to the friction between the stone and pebble, the stone turns to the inside or outside, causing the stone to "curl." The amount of curl can change during a game as the pebble wears. The surface of the ice is maintained at a temperature around 23 Â°F (âˆ’5 Â°C).
Making and maintaining perfect ice conditions at a curling club is as much art as science.[8] Most curling clubs have an ice maker, whose main job is to care for the ice. At the major curling championships, ice maintenance is extremely important. Well-known professional ice makers Shorty Jenkins, Hans Wuthrich, Darrin Sinclair, Dan Prohaszka, and Dave Merklinger reside in Canada. Large events, such as the Brier or other national championships, are typically held in an arena that presents a challenge to the ice maker, as they must constantly monitor and adjust the ice and air temperatures as well as air humidity levels to ensure a consistent playing surface. It is common for each sheet of ice to have multiple sensors embedded in order to monitor surface temperature, as well as probes set up in the seating area (to monitor humidity) and in the compressor room (to monitor brine supply and return temperatures).
On the sheet, a 12-foot (3.7 m) wide set of concentric rings, called the house, is painted near each end of the rink. The centre of the house, known as the button, is marked by the junction of two lines that divide the house into quarters. The two lines are the centre line, which is drawn lengthwise down the centre of the sheet, and the tee line, drawn 16 feet (4.9 m) from the backboard and parallel to it. Two other linesâ€”the hog linesâ€”are drawn parallel to each backboard and 37 feet (11 m) from them.
The rings that surround the button are defined by their diameter as the four-foot, eight-foot, and twelve-foot rings. They are usually distinguished by colour. The inner rings are merely a visual aid for judging which stone is closer to the centre; they do not affect scoring. However, a stone that is not at least touching the outside of the 12-foot (3.7 m) ring (i.e., more than 6 feet (1.8 m) from the centre) is not in the house and therefore does not score (see below).
Located twelve feet behind the button are the "hacks." A hack is a device used to provide traction to the curler making a shot; the curler places the foot he or she will push off with in the hack. On indoor rinks, there are usually two fixed hacksâ€”rubber-lined holesâ€”one on each side of the centre line, with the inside edge no more than 3 inches (76 mm) from the centre line and the front edge on the hack line. A single moveable hack may also be used.

Curling is played between two teams of four curlers each, with team members named for the usual order in which they play. The lead plays first, then the second, the third (or mate or vice), and finally the fourth.
The fourth is typically the skip (team captain). For example, Canadian skip Brad Gushue's 2006 Olympic Gold Winning team line up was lead, second, third, skip. But, there are exceptions where the skip takes another place. For example, Canadian skips Randy Ferbey and Russ Howard throw third and second, respectively. The position at which the skip (team captain) throws will be renamed with skip. For example, Randy Ferbey's team line up was lead, second, skip, fourth.

The lead, or first, throws the team's first two stones of an end (round of play), and sweeps for the other team members. Strategically, the lead usually has similar shots from end to end, usually throwing guards or draws. The placement of the lead's rocks will usually dictate how the strategy for the end sets up.

The second throws the team's third and fourth stones and sweeps for all other players. The second's role when shooting is often to remove opposition stones in front of the house, as his or her shots are the first rocks thrown after the end of the free guard zone (see below).

Also called the vice skip, vice, or mate, the third throws the team's fifth and sixth stones and usually sweeps for the second and the lead. The third usually assists the skip in his or her duties. When it is the skip's turn to throw, it is usually the third who holds the broom for the skip.
After each end, the thirds for both teams must reach an agreement as to which team scored and with how many points. If there is a disagreement or uncertainty, the thirds will call an official to see which ones are closer. If no officials are present, the thirds will measure themselves; at this time, only the thirds are allowed in the house. In major tournaments, the scorekeeping is left to an official. Depending on the tradition, when the third's team scores, the third will record it on the scoreboard.
Depending on the tradition, the third may flip a coin, with the opposing third to determine who will have last-rock (hammer) advantage at the beginning of a game. (In some areas, primarily the Ottawa area, the lead does this.) The winner of the toss has the option to pick either last rock or the colour of the rocks they wish to play with. In major tournaments, these decisions are usually made beforehand.

The skip is the captain of the team, and he or she determines strategy. Based on such strategy, the skip holds the broom indicating where the player throwing must aim ("calling the shot"). When it is the skip's turn to throw, the vice skip (usually the third) holds the broom. The skip usually throws the last two rocks of the end; however, some teams have the skip throwing in other positions.
The skip rarely does any sweeping, except in the house and behind the tee line. The skip is required to stay out of the playing area when it is the other team's turn, but he or she is allowed to sweep stones in motion behind the tee line as a result of their shot. In international rules, the player in charge of the house is the only player allowed to sweep their opponent's stones behind the tee line. For most of the end, this is the skip; but when the skip is throwing, the vice skip takes charge of the house.

Except in international or some national and provincial events in Canada and the United States, a team will usually be identified by the last name of the skip. For example, Kevin Martin's foursome is known as "Team Martin," unless they are representing Canada in the World Championships or the Olympics, in which case they would be known as "Team Canada."
There is a movement afoot in Winnipeg, Manitoba, however, advocating against traditional skip-only naming. A team based out of the Fort Rouge Curling Club is calling themselves The Right Offs.[9] Their belief is that naming the team after the skip alone is offensive to the equally important front end.

Teams comprise either four men (a men's team) or four women (a women's team), or two men and two women (a mixed team) as either a man skipping and a man playing second or a man vicing and a man playing lead. There are world championships contested in men's and women's curling, but not for mixed curling. Canada organizes a mixed national championship that is held early in the season. Most individual clubs that offer mixed leagues for members use them as recreational events, but there are also very competitive mixed teams who aim for high-level tournaments and cashspiels.


Casual players may wear running shoes and improvise a slider by applying electrical tape (or something similar) to their off foot.
Higher-end shoes are often made of leather, while lower-end shoes are often made of vinyl.

The curling broom is used to sweep the ice surface in front of the rock. Aggressive sweeping momentarily melts the ice, which lessens friction, thereby lessening the rock's deceleration while straightening its trajectory. The broom can also be used to clean debris off the ice, which is important to keep a throw from "picking" (see "Delivering the rock," below). The skip will also hold a broom at the end of the rink opposite from the delivering player as a target for the deliverer to aim the rock toward.
In earlier days, brooms were made of corn strands and were similar to household brooms. Brushes were used primarily by elderly curlers as a substitute for corn brooms. Today, brushes have replaced traditional corn brooms at every level of curling, but are universally referred to as brooms. Curling brushes may have fabric, hog hair, or horsehair heads. Most top quality modern broomsticks are now made of materials such as carbon fibre, allowing faster sweeping; lower-end brooms are often made of fibreglass. Brooms are also used by most curlers as a balancing aid during delivery of the stone.

The curling stone, as defined by the World Curling Federation, is circular in shape and weighs between 38 and 44 pounds (17 and 20 kg) with a handle and bolt attached[7]. The stone has a maximum allowable circumference of 36 inches (910 mm).[7] A stone must be a minimum of 4.5 inches (110 mm) in height.[7] The handle is attached to the stone by means of a bolt that runs vertically through a hole in the center of the stone. The handle allows the rock to be gripped and rotated upon release. When the rock is thrown with the right hand, clockwise rotation is referred to as an in-turn; counterclockwise rotation is referred to as an out-turn. The opposites are true if the rock is thrown with the left hand. The handles are coloured to differentiate the rocks belonging to each team. Two p
