List of Futurama episodes
The following is an episode list for the FOX animated television series Futurama. The series began on March 28, 1999 and ended on August 10, 2003. However, four direct-to-DVD movies have been released and being aired as 16 individual episodes on Comedy Central, the first having aired on March 23, 2008. All four original production seasons are available on DVD. The DVD sets were entitled "Season #" in the Region 2 and Region 4 releases; however they were renamed to "Volume #" for Region 1. The Complete Collection DVD set was released on October 25, 2004 in Region 2, and on March 22, 2005 in Region 1.
Futurama was originally created as four seasons; however, FOX originally broadcast it out of the intended order as five seasons. This list is in production order, primarily because this is the order used on the DVDs, as intended by the artists, and it helps avoid plot inconsistencies. A list in broadcast order can be viewed at the Infosphere.
The production code is the code used by FOX to indicate the production order of the episodes, and is in the format #ACV##. The first number represents the production season. ACV is FOX's series code for Futurama. The second number is the episode's number. The TV broadcast code indicates the broadcast order. It is in the format S0#E##, where S0# indicates the broadcasting season of which there were 5, and E## indicates the episode's number.
Futurama's episode ratings in the United States are TV-PG (in its earlier episodes on FOX) and TV-14 (in its later episodes on FOX, on Cartoon Network, and on Comedy Central). In the UK, episodes have been assigned U, PG and 12 ratings (the U rating was for the episode Leela's Homeworld).
Season five is being aired on Comedy Central during 2008-2009. It consists of the four straight-to-DVD films divided into sixteen individual episodes. Each four-episode set will be aired after the release of the accompanying film. In addition to airing the new season, Comedy Central has taken over syndication of the previous episodes.[1]
