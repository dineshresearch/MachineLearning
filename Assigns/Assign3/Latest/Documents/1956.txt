PEBKAC
PEBKAC is an acronym which stands for "Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair".[1] The phrase is used by computer experts as a humorous[2] way to describe user errors.
In 2006, Intel began running a number of PEBKAC web-based advertisements[3] to promote its vPro platform.

The automotive repairpersons' version is referring to the cause of a problem as a "loose nut between the steering wheel and the seat."
