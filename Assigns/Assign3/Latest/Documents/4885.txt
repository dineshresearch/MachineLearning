GNU Scientific Library
In computing, the GNU Scientific Library (or GSL) is a software library written in the C programming language for numerical calculations in applied mathematics and science. The GSL is part of the GNU project and is distributed under the GNU General Public License.
Software which uses GSL includes PSPP and Perl Data Language.

The following example program calculates the value of the Bessel function for 5 [1]:
The example program has to be linked to the GSL library upon compilation:
The output is shown below, and should be correct to double-precision accuracy:

The software library provides facilities for:

The GSL can be used in C++ classes, but not using pointers to member functions, because the type of pointer to member function is different from pointer to function [2]. Instead, pointers to static functions have to be used. C++ wrappers for GSL are available [3], although many are not regularly maintained.
