John the Baptist
John the Baptist (Arabic: Ÿäÿ≠ŸäŸâ‚Äé Ya·∏•y√° or ŸäŸàÿ≠ŸÜÿß Y≈´·∏•annƒÅ, Aramaic Yohanoun) (died c 30)[1][2] was a mission preacher[3] and a major religious figure[4] who led a movement of baptism at the Jordan River in expectation of a divine apocalypse that would restore occupied Israel.[5] John followed the example of previous Hebrew prophets, living austerely, challenging sinful rulers, calling for repentance, and promising God's justice.
Some scholars maintain that he was influenced by the Essenes, who were semi-ascetic, expected an apocalypse, and had rituals similar to baptism.[6] John's baptism was a purification rite for repentant sinners, performed in "living water" (in this case a running river) in accord with Jewish custom. John anticipated a messianic figure who would be greater than John himself.[7] Jesus, the central figure of Christianity, was among those whom John baptized. It has been suggested that Jesus may have been a follower of John.[5][8] Herod Antipas saw John as a threat and had him executed.[4] Jesus' own ministry followed John's, and some of Jesus' early followers had previously been followers of John.[9] John, like Jesus, preached at a time of political, social, and religious conflict.
Accounts of John in the New Testament are not incompatible with the account in Josephus, whose authority is respected.[10] Here, Jesus is the one whose coming John foretold. Herod has John imprisoned for denouncing his marriage, and he is later executed.[3] Christians commonly refer to John as the precursor or forerunner of Jesus,[11] since in the Gospels, John announces Jesus' coming. He is also identified with the prophet Elijah,[9] and is described as a relative of Jesus.[12]
Because Scripture described John as endowed with prenatal grace, the feast day of his birth (June 24) became celebrated more solemnly than that marking his martyrdom (August 29).[3] Muslims also regard John as a prophet,[13] as do Bah√°'√≠s[14] and Mandaeans. In art, John's head often appears on a platter because that is what Herod's stepdaughter, Salome, is said to have asked for.[15] Another theme of Christian art is his beheading.[1] He is also depicted as an ascetic wearing camel hair and with a staff and scroll inscribed "Ecce Agnus Dei" (Latin, "Behold the Lamb of God" ‚Äî John 1:29) or bearing a book or dish with a lamb on it.[3] In Orthodox icons, he often has angel's wings, since Mark 1:2 describes him as ·ºÑŒ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒøœÇ (angelos) or messenger.[10]

All four Gospels record John the Baptist's ministry. They depict him as proclaiming Christ's arrival. In the Synoptics (Mark, Matthew, and Luke), Jesus is baptized. In Matthew and John, John the Baptist recognizes Jesus as the one he had fore told.

The Gospel of Luke includes an account of John's infancy, introducing him as the son of Zachariah, an old man, and his wife Elizabeth, who was sterile.[16] According to this account the birth of John was foretold by the angel Gabriel to Zachariah, while Zachariah was performing his functions as a priest in the temple of Jerusalem; since Zachariah is described as a priest of the course of Abijah, and his wife, Elizabeth, as one of the daughters of Aaron[17] this would make John a descendant of Aaron on both his father's and mother's side.[18]
The Gospel of Luke states that Jesus was conceived when Elizabeth was about six months pregnant; when Mary came to tell her about her news, Elizabeth's unborn baby 'jumped for joy' in her womb.[19] Zachariah had lost his speech at the behest and prophecy of the angel Gabriel,[20] and it was restored on the occasion of Zachariah naming John.[21] On the basis of Luke's account, the Catholic calendar placed the feast of John the Baptist on June 24, six months before Christmas.[22] According to Luke, Jesus and John the Baptist were related, their mothers being cousins;[23] there is no mention of this in the other Gospels, and the scholar Raymond E. Brown has described the relationship as 'of dubious historicity';[24] G√©za Vermes has called it 'artificial and undoubtedly Luke's creation'.[25]
The very close similarities between the accounts of the birth of Samuel in the Old Testament have led scholars to suggest that this is the model for the Gospel of Luke story of the birth of John and of the annunciation and birth of Jesus.[26]

All four canonical gospels relate to John's ministry, his preaching and baptism in the River Jordan. Most notably he is the one who recognized Jesus as the Messiah, and on Jesus' request, baptized him. The baptism marked the beginning of Jesus' ministry. The Gospels of Mark, Matthew and (most clearly) Luke relate that Jesus came from Galilee to John and was baptized by him, whereupon the Spirit descended upon him and a voice from Heaven told him he was God's Son. Their lives (e.g., births) are believed to have been similar, although in Christianity, John is thought of as last prophet and Jesus as the Messiah.
The problem that Jesus, considered by Christians to be without sin, received John's baptism, which was for the forgiveness of sins, is addressed in the Gospel of Matthew's account, which has John refusing to baptize Jesus, saying, "I need to be baptized by you," until Jesus convinces him to baptize him nonetheless (Matthew 3:13‚Äì15). The Gospel of John does not describe John baptizing Jesus but has John introducing Jesus to his disciples as the "Lamb of God" (John 1:29‚Äì34).
The Gospel of John reports that Jesus' disciples were baptizing and that a debate broke out between some of the disciples of John and another Jew about purification with John explaining that Jesus "must become greater" while he, John, "must become less" (John 3:22‚Äì36). Gospel of John then points out that Jesus' disciples were baptizing more people than John (John 4:2). Later, the Gospel relates Jesus regarding John as "a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light". (John 5:35).
The book of Acts portrays the disciples of John as eventually merging into the followers of Jesus (Acts 18:24‚Äì19:6), a development not reported by the Gospels except for the early case of Andrew, Simon Peter's brother (John 1:35‚Äì42). On various occasions the Gospels relate John denying any claim to be the Messiah and clearly acknowledging his inferiority to Jesus. However, scholars such as Harold W. Attridge contend that John's status as a "self-conscious and deliberate forerunner of Jesus" is likely to be an invention by early Christians, arguing that "for the early church it would have been something of an embarrassment to say that Jesus, who was in their minds superior to John the Baptist, had been baptized by him."[27]

According to the canonical Gospels, John the Baptist's public ministry was brought to a close when he was imprisoned on orders of Herod Antipas. The synoptic Gospels state that Herod Antipas reacted to John's condemnation of his marriage to Herodias, the former wife of his half-brother Herod II.[28] Josephus locates John's imprisonment in the fortress of Machaerus on the southern extremity of Peraea, nine miles (14†km) east of the Dead Sea (Josephus, Jewish Antiquities XVIII:5:1‚Äì2). Matthew relates that the imprisoned John sent messengers to Jesus to ask him whether he was the Messiah. Jesus indirectly answered in the affirmative and described John in terms of a return of the prophet Elijah (Matthew 11:2‚Äì15).
Regarding John's death, Josephus states that Herod had John killed to preempt a possible uprising. Matthew links John's death as well with Herodias, as he related that her daughter Salome[29]so much delighted Antipas with a dance that he vowed to grant her any wish to which, after asking her mother (Herodias), she demanded the head of John the Baptist. (Matthew 14:6‚Äì8) The Gospels date John's death before the crucifixion of Jesus. Josephus places John's death no later than 36 CE. Neither Josephus nor the Gospels state where John was buried, though the Gospels state that John's disciples took his body and placed it in a tomb and then told Jesus all that had occurred, to which Jesus replied that there had been no greater son of woman than John the Baptist (Matthew 14:3‚Äì12). In the time of Julian the Apostate, however, his tomb was shown at Samaria, where the inhabitants opened it and burned part of his bones. The rest of the alleged remains were saved by some Christians, who carried them to an abbot of Jerusalem named Philip.[30]

Christians believe that John the Baptist had a specific role ordained by God which was to be the forerunner or precursor to the Messiah, whom they believe to be Jesus. This is because it speaks of his role in all the gospels. In Luke 1:17 the role of John is referred to as being "to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord." In Luke 1:76 as "...thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways and in Luke 1:77 as being "To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins."
There are several passages within the Old Testament which are interpreted by Christians as being prophetic of John the Baptist in this role due to the way they are referred to in the New Testament passages. These include a passage in the Book of Malachi 3:1 that refers to a prophet who would prepare the way of the Lord:
and also at the end of the next chapter in Malachi 4:5-6 where it says,
The Bible applies these passages to John in the book of Matthew[31]the book of Mark[32] and by an angel of God in Luke[33]
The idea of there needing to be a forerunner before the Messiah came was not unique to the Christians, but was also believed by the leaders of the Jews also at the time of Jesus. It seems however that they were expecting Elijah the prophet to come, not John the Baptist, due to a literal interpretation of the last quote from Malachi. In fact at one stage it seems they used it as a proof that Jesus was not the Messiah. This explains why the disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 17:10, 'Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?.' Eventually the disciples end up understanding in verse 13 that Elijah had come in John in a spiritual or allegorical sense.

An account of John the Baptist is found in all extant manuscripts of the Jewish Antiquities (book 18, chapter 5, 2) by Flavius Josephus (37‚Äì100):[34]
As with other passages in Josephus relating to Christian themes concern remains over whether the passage was part of Josephus's original text or instead a later interpolation. Skeptical writer Frank Zindler argues that the passage is an interpolation by a Sabian.[36] The passage dates to at least the early third century as it is quoted by Origen in Contra Celsum. It was also quoted by Eusebius of Caesarea in the fourth century.
According to this passage, the execution of John was blamed for a defeat Herod suffered ca. 36 CE. Divergences between the passage's presentation and the Biblical accounts of John include baptism for those whose souls have already been "purified beforehand by righteousness" is for purification of the body, not general repentance of sin (Mark 1:4). Biblical scholar John Dominic Crossan differentiates between Josephus's account of John and Jesus like this: "John had a monopoly, but Jesus had a franchise." To get baptized, Crossan writes[clarification needed], you went only to John; to stop the movement one only needed to stop John (therefore his movement ended with his death). Jesus invited all to come and see how he and his companions had already accepted the Government of God, entered it and were living it. Such a communal praxis was not just for himself, but could survive without him, unlike John's movement.[37]
