Psychedelic plants
Psychedelic plants are plants that contain psychedelic drugs. Some of them have been used for thousands of years for religious purposes.

Cannabis (Marijuana) is a popular psychedelic plant. Cannabis is also unique in that it contains a psychedelic substance, THC, which contains no nitrogen and is not an indole, phenethylamine, anticholinergic (deliriant), or a disassociative drug. It is among the weakest of the psychedelics.[citation needed] Currently, certain universities and research firms are studying the medicinal effects of cannabis. Many US states such as California and many countries have created a Medical Cannabis law to allow patients to use cannabis as (among other things) a pain killer and appetite stimulant.

Many of the psychedelic plants contain dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which is either snorted (Virola, Yopo snuffs), smoked, or drunk with MAOIs (Ayahuasca). It can not simply be eaten, and it needs to be extremely concentrated to be smokable.
