Klaus Kinski
Klaus Kinski (18 October 1926 – 23 November 1991) was a German actor, famous for his ability to project onscreen intensity, and for his explosive temperament. He acted in over 130 films.

In 1950, Kinski had a three-day stay in a psychiatric hospital; medical records from the period listed a preliminary diagnosis of schizophrenia.[1]

Kinski appeared in several German Edgar Wallace movies. His collaborations with director Werner Herzog brought him international recognition. In all they made five films together; Aguirre: The Wrath of God (1972), Woyzeck (1978), Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979), Fitzcarraldo (1982), and finally Cobra Verde (1987). In 1977 he starred as terrorist Wilfried Böse in the Israeli movie Operation Thunderbolt, based on the events of the 1976 Operation Entebbe. His last film (which he also wrote and directed) was Kinski Paganini (1989), in which he played the legendary violinist Niccolò Paganini.

Kinski chronicled his exploits in the autobiography—Kinski: All I Need Is Love, which was largely fabricated to generate sales, according to Werner Herzog's documentary film My Best Fiend.
He is the father of actress Nastassja Kinski, although he had little contact with her following the divorce from her mother, Ruth Brigitte Tocki, in 1968.

Herzog's retrospective on his work with Kinski was released in the United States as My Best Fiend (1999).
The American antifolk music group Elastic No-No Band created a song called "I Am Klaus Kinski (And This Is My Song)", which is an imaginary response by Kinski to Herzog's film My Best Fiend.



Kinski released nearly 25 spoken word records, some of them were re-released on CDs[3].
