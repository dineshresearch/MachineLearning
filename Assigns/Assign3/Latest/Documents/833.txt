NRS social grade
The NRS social grades are a system of demographic classification used in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. They were originally developed by the National Readership Survey in order to classify readers but are now used by many other organisations for wider applications and have become a standard for market research.[1]

The classifications are based on the occupation of the head of the household.[1]
The grades are often grouped into ABC1 and C2DE and these are taken to equate to middle class and working class respectively. Only around 2% of the UK population identifies as upper class,[2] and this group is not included in the classification scheme.
