The Beslan school hostage crisis (also referred to as the Beslan school siege or Beslan massacre)[2][3][4] began when a group of armed terrorists, demanding an end to the Second Chechen War, took more than 1,100 people (including some 777 children[5]) hostage on September 1, 2004, at School Number One (SNO) in the town of Beslan, North Ossetia-Alania, an autonomous republic in the North Caucasus region of the Russian Federation. On the third day of the standoff, Russian security forces stormed the building using tanks, thermobaric rockets and other heavy weapons.[6] A series of explosions shook the school, followed by a fire which engulfed the building and a chaotic gunbattle between the hostage-takers and Russian security forces. Ultimately, at least 334 hostages were killed, including 186 children.[7][8] Hundreds more were wounded or reported missing.
The hostage taking was carried out by the Riyadus-Salikhin Reconnaissance and Sabotage Battalion of Chechen Martyrs group lead by Shamil Basayev who was an independent warlord at the time. The tragedy led to security and political repercussions in Russia, most notably a series of government reforms consolidating power in the Kremlin and strengthening of the powers of President of Russia.[9] As of 2008, there are many aspects of the crisis still in dispute, including how many militants were involved, their preparations, and whether some of them had escaped. Questions about the government's management of the crisis have also persisted, including disinformation and censorship in news media, repressions of journalists who rushed to Beslan,[10] the nature and content of negotiations with the militants, the responsibility for the bloody outcome, and the government's use of possibly excessive force.[6][11][12][13][14]


Comintern Street SNO, located next to the district police station, was one of sixteen schools in Beslan. It had some 110 teachers and several support staff and more than 1100 students.[15] The gymnasium, where most of the estimated 1,900 hostages were to spend 52 hours, was a recent addition; it measured 10 metres wide and 25 metres long.[16] There were reports that the men disguised as repairmen had concealed weapons and explosives in the school in during the works in July 2004, but this was later officially refuted. However, witnesses have since testified they were made to help their captors remove the weapons from the caches hidden in the school.[17][18] There are also claims that the terrorists in advance constructed a sniper's nest on the sports hall roof.[19]
It was also claimed that the SNO in Beslan was used by Ossetian militia as an internment camp for Ingush civilians during the 1992 Ossetian-Ingush conflict, and it was chosen as a target because of this connection.[20][21][22] According to media reports, SNO was one of several buildings in which North Ossetians had held Ingush citizens, many of them women and children; the hostages sat on the gymnasium floor, deprived of food and water, just as the Ossetians would do in the 2004 siege, and several male hostages were hauled outside and executed.[23] Beslan, like the nearby Mozdok, was also the site of an airfield used by the Russian military aviation for its operation in Chechnya since 1994.[24]
The initial attack took place on September 1, the traditional start of the Russian school year, referred to as "First September" or Day of Knowledge.[25] On this day, the children, accompanied by their parents and other relatives, attend ceremonies hosted by their school.[26] Because of the pupils and family members attending the Day of Knowledge festivities, the number of people in the schools was considerably higher than usual for a normal school day. Early in the morning, a group of several dozen heavily-armed rebel guerrillas left a forest encampment in the vicinity of the village of Psedakh in the nearby Russian republic of Ingushetia. On the way to Beslan they had captured an Ingush police Major Sultan Gurazhev on a country road near the North Ossetian village of Khurikau.[27] Gurazhev escaped after reaching the town and then went to a district police department to let them know that his pistol and badge were taken away.[28]
At 09:30 local time, attackers wearing military camouflage and black balaclava masks, and in some cases also wearing explosive belts, arrived at SNO in a stolen police GAZ van and a GAZ-66 military truck. Many witnesses and independent experts claim that there were, in fact, two groups of attackers, and that the first group was already at the school when the second group arrived by truck.[29] At first, some at the school mistook the terrorists for Russian forces practicing a security drill.[30] However, the attackers resolved this misconception by shooting in the air and forcing everybody from the school grounds into the building. During the initial chaos, up to 50 people managed to flee and alert authorities to the situation.[31] A number of people also managed to hide in the boiler room.[16] After an exchange of gunfire with local police and an armed civilian, in which it was reported one attacker was shot dead and two were wounded, the attackers seized the school building.[32] Reports of the death toll from the shootout ranged from two to eight people, with more than a dozen wounded.
The attackers took approximately 1,100[33] to 1,200[6] hostages (the number was inititially downplayed by the government to merely 200-400, and then for an unknown reason announced to be exactly 354;[10] in 2005, the number was put at 1,128[11]). The militants herded their captives into the school's gym, and confiscated all mobile phones under the pain of death.[34] They ordered everyone to speak in Russian and only when spoken to; when a father named Ruslan Betrozov stood to calm people and repeat the rules in the local language, Ossetic, a gunman approached and killed him with a single shot to the head. Another father named Vadim Bolloyev, who refused to kneel, was also shot and then bled to death.[35] Their bodies were dragged from the sports hall, leaving a trail of blood later visible in the video made by the terrorists.
After gathering the hostages in the gym, the attackers singled out among the male teachers, school employees and fathers the 15-20 strongest adults they apparently thought might represent a threat, and took them into a corridor next to the cafeteria on the second floor, where a deadly blast took place. An explosive belt on one of the female bombers detonated, killing another female bomber (it was also claimed the second woman died from a bullet wound[36]) and several of the selected hostages, as well as mortally wounding one male terrorist. According to the version presented by the surviving hostage-taker, the blast was actually triggered by Polkovnik, the group leader, when he set off the bomb by remote control to kill those who openly disagreed about the child hostages and intimidate other possible dissenters.[37] The hostages still alive were ordered to lie down and then shot with automatic rifle by another gunman; all but one of them were killed.[38][39][40][41][42] The militants then forced other hostages to throw the bodies out of the building and to wash the blood off the floor.[43] A hostage named Aslan Kudzayev, who was forced to throw the bodies, escaped by jumping out the window; the authorities briefly detained him as a suspected hostage-taker.[35] Karen Mdinaradze, the Alania football team's cameraman, survived the explosion as well as the shooting; when discovered to be still alive, he was allowed to return to the sports hall, where he finally lost consciousness.[35][44]

A security cordon was soon established around the school, consisting of the Russian police (militsiya) and Russian Army forces; OSNAZ, including the elite Alfa and Vympel units of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB); and the OMON special units of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD). A line of three apartment buildings facing the school gym was evacuated and taken over by the special forces. The perimeter they made was within 250 yards (230 m) of the school, inside the range of the terrorists' grenade launchers.[45] No fire-fighting equipment was in position and, despite the previous experiences of the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis, there were few ambulances ready.[16] The chaos was worsened by the presence of Ossetian militiamen (opolchentsy) and armed civilians among the crowds of relatives who had gathered at the scene;[46] there were perhaps as many as 5,000 of them.[16]
The attackers mined the gym and the rest of the building with improvised explosive devices, and surrounded it with tripwires. In a further bid to deter rescue attempts, they threatened to kill 50 hostages for every one of their own members killed by the police, and to kill 20 hostages for every gunman injured.[16] They also threatened to blow up the school if government forces attacked. To avoid being overwhelmed by gas attack like their comrades in the 2002 Moscow theater siege, the rebels quickly smashed the school's windows. The captors prevented hostages from eating and drinking (calling this a "hunger strike", which they said they joined too) until North Ossetia's President Alexander Dzasokhov would arrive to negotiate with them.[43] However, the FSB set up their own crisis headquarters (HQ) from which Dzasokhov was excluded, and threatened to arrest him if he tried to go to the school.[6][47]
The Russian government annonounced that it would not use force to rescue the hostages, and negotiations towards a peaceful resolution took place on the first and second days, at first led by Leonid Roshal, a pediatrician whom the hostage takers had reportedly asked for by name (Roshal had helped negotiate the release of children in the 2002 Moscow siege, but also had given advice to the Russian security services as they prepared to storm the theater, for which he received the Hero of Russia award). However, a witness statement in the court indicated that the Russian negotiators confused Roshal with Vladimir Rushailo, a Russian security official.[48] According to Savelyev' report, the official ("civilian") HQ was looking for a peaceful resolution of the situation at the same time when the secret ("heavy") HQ set up by the FSB was preparing the assault. Savelyev wrote that in many ways the "heavies" restricted the actions of the "civilians", in particular in their attempts to negotiate with the militants.[49]
At Russia's request, a special meeting of the United Nations Security Council was convened on the evening of September 1, at which the council members demanded "the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages of the terrorist attack".[50] U.S. President George W. Bush made a statement offering "support in any form" to Russia.[51] That night, the hostage takers began exploring the area surrounding the school, preparing for an exit strategy once their demands had been met.[52]

On September 2, 2004, negotiations between Roshal and the hostage-takers proved unsuccessful, and they refused to allow food, water, and medicines to be taken in for the hostages, or for the bodies of the dead to be removed from the front of the school.[35] At noon, FSB First Deputy Director Colonel General Vladimir Pronichev showed Dzasokhov a decree signed by the Prime Minister of Russia Mikhail Fradkov appointing North Ossetian FSB chief Major General Valery Andreyev as head of the operational HQ.[53] In April 2005, however, a Moscow News journalist received photocopies of the interview protocols of Dzasokhov and Andreyev by investigators that revealed that two headquarters had been formed in Beslan: a formal one, upon which was laid all responsibility; and a secret one, which took the real decisions, and Andreyev had never been in charge there.[54]
The Russian government downplayed the numbers, repeatedly stating there were only 354 hostages; this reportedly angered the attackers who further mistreated their captives.[55][56] Several officials also said there appeared to be only 15 to 20 militants in the school.[15] The crisis was responded with a near-total silence from President of Russia Vladimir Putin and the rest of Russia's political leaders.[57] Only on the second day Putin made his first public comment on the siege during a meeting in Moscow with the King Abdullah II of Jordan: "Our main task, of course, is to save the lives and health of those who became hostages. All actions by our forces involved in rescuing the hostages will be dedicated exclusively to this task."[58] It was the only public statement by Putin about the crisis until one day after its bloody end.
