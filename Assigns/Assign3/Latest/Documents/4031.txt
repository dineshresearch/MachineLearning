Cash flow
Cash flow refers to the movement of cash into or out of a business, or project, or financial product. It is usually measured during a specified, finite period of time. Measurement of cash flow can be used
Cash flow is a generic term used differently depending on the context. It may be defined by users for their own purposes. It can refer to actual past flows, or to projected future flows. It can refer to the total of all the flows involved or to only a subset of those flows. Subset terms include 'net cash flow', operating cash flow and free cash flow.


Cash flows are classified into:
All three together - the net cash flow - are necessary to reconcile the beginning cash balance to the ending cash balance.

Common methods include:

In this example the following types of flows are included:
Let us, for example, compare two companies using only total cash flow and then separate cash flow streams. The last three years show the following total cash flows:
Company A:
Year 1:		cash flow of +10M
Year 2:		cash flow of +11M
Year 3:		cash flow of +12M
Company B:
Year 1:		cash flow of +15M
Year 2:		cash flow of +16M
Year 3:		cash flow of +17M
Company B has a higher yearly cash flow and looks like a better one in which to invest. Now let us see how their cash flows are made up:
Company A:
Year 1:		OC: +20M 	FC: +5M 		IC: -15M, total	= +10M
Year 2:		OC: +21M 	FC: +5M	 	IC: -15M, total	= +11M
Year 3:		OC: +22M 	FC: +5M 		IC: -15M, total = +12M
Company B:
Year 1:		OC: +10M 	FC: +5M 		IC: 0, total = +15M
Year 2:		OC: +11M 	FC: +5M 		IC: 0, total = +16M
Year 3:		OC: +12M 	FC: +5M 		IC: 0, total = +17M
Now it shows that Company A is actually earning more cash by its core activities and has already spent 45M in long term investments, of which the revenues will only show up after three years. When comparing investments using cash flows always make sure to use the same cash flow layout.
