Verizon FiOS
Verizon FiOS is a bundled communications (Internet, telephone, and TV) service that is presently offered in some areas of the United States by Verizon. Verizon has attracted consumer and media attention in the area of broadband Internet access as the first major U.S. carrier to offer fiber to the home/premises. Other service providers currently only use fiber optics deployment to the network backbone and use existing copper or coax infrastructure for the end user. The coverage area is still expanding, however some areas do not have service or cannot receive TV and phone service due to franchise agreements. As of 2009[update] the number of homes with FiOS access was 12.7 million, of which 2.5 million subscribe to the Internet service, and 2.04 million to FiOS TV.[1][2]
"FiOS" stands for "Fiber Optic Service."[3] As noted in Verizon's trademark, fios is a Gaelic word, translated into English as "knowledge."[4] Verizon previously called the service FTTP ("Fiber To The Premises").


Internet throughput speeds are highly variable depending upon service territory and are affected by such factors as customer location, cost, and the offerings of the competing broadband providers. Offered speeds in various areas have been changed with little notice, generally to raise throughput (but also prices in some cases). End customers usually have three or more choices for Internet bandwidth. The lowest bandwidth tier was originally 5 Mbit/s down and 2 Mbit/s up and is now 10 Mbit/s down and 2 Mbit/s up in most territories. Most customers may upgrade to an even higher download speed for a small additional fee (in most East Coast territories, ten dollars was typical as of late 2007). For example, customers in the new Baltimore service area may upgrade to 20 Mbit/s download / 5 Mbit/s upload for $10 per month (difference in stand-alone price over 10Mbit/s up / 2 Mbit/s down offering). A third (or higher) service tier, when available for residential service, tends to provide very considerableâ€”nearly commercialâ€”bandwidth, including substantial upload speed, in some territories reaching 30/15 or 50/20 Mbit/s download and upload. Again, depending on market conditions, the third and higher tiers may be offered for either modest per month price increases over the second tier, or for substantially more.

Residential, going from lowest to highest offered bandwidth tiers
The prices for the bundles vary based on bandwidth level and whether or not phone service is included. From the Verizon website, the prices range from $44.99/month (only with a one-year service contract, with home phone service, and 10Mbit/2Mbit internet service), to $165.95 (only on a month-to-month agreement, not including home phone service, and 50Mbit/20Mbit internet service [5]




Service tiers include:
Only basic tier and Music channels are available in Clear QAM.[9] All other service tiers are DRM encrypted and require renting a digital set-top box or CableCARD, which tunes the QAM television signal and decrypts for display on the television set.
Television is now available on FiOS business installations though in some circumstances Verizon will install a second optical network terminal to provide television to a location that already has business FiOS.
As of June 2008 FiOS ceased carrying analog television signals in parallel with digital channels. However, since the inception of its television service FiOS has carried analog conversion as standard definition digital (2.0 Mbit/s) on the 451 MHz frequency QAM of all analog cable channels. Reception of these channels requires a QAM tuner.[10]
A subscription to Extreme HD with all the movie channels will bring over 100 HD channels.
Along with DirecTV and Dish Network, FiOS is also one of the few pay-TV services that includes NFL Network on its basic tier, including it in their Essentials and Extreme HD packages instead of putting it with its Sports package as with other cable and satellite operators.

Verizon also offers analog service, or POTS, over FiOS. The common model optical network terminals have 2 or 4 analog phone jacks. Verizon claims not to do anything that would affect or disable the pre-existing copper lines that carried phone service or DSL, though the official company policy is that customers cannot retreat back to copper service without higher level management approval[citation needed]. However, there have in fact been reports in various markets that Verizon has physically deinstalled the copper lines (or the Network interface device, necessary for copper-line phone service) at the time that FiOS was installed, effectively removing any "path of retreat" to copper based services.[11] Verizon is required by law to share copper media with competing service providers, but no such requirement exists for fiber media.
Power outages may affect service availability. Since fiber-optic service does not carry power from the exchange as copper service does, the customer's power is used instead. This means that if there is no electricity at the premises, telephone service will be interrupted. This may be an issue for sites that experience extended power outages that depend on analog phone lines for remote monitoring, alarm systems, and/or emergency calls. Verizon provides a rechargeable battery backup unit free with installation of the service. Older units allow for 4 hours of power to the optical network terminal during a power outage, while newer units installed as of 2008[update] allow for 8 hours.

Feb'2009 Verizon launched the 'Fios Digital Voice' in Maryland region. There will be an unlimited plan and a pay by the minute plan at launch. FiOS Digital Voice Account Manager (FVAM) to manage and control their FiOS Digital Voice features. The FVAM can be used to set calling options, listen to voice mail, manage their mailboxes, including recording their own customized greeting or to track all Incoming and Outgoing calls that includes times, dates, phone numbers, etc. [12]

While Verizon says it is expanding its coverage, there is speculation that FiOS may never materialize in some markets. For example, according to a May 10, 2006 Wall St. Journal article by Dionne Searcey and Dennis Berman: [13]
Verizon Communications Inc. is fielding offers for [sale of] ... of traditional telephone lines ... part of the New York-based phone giant's strategy to delve deeper into the wireless and broadband arenas, while getting out of the traditional phone business in U.S. areas that aren't slated for fiber upgrades ... Verizon also has been shopping a package dubbed "GTE North" that comprises about 3.4 million access lines in former GTE Corp. territories in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio and Michigan.
In the markets of Northern New England that were once controlled by Verizon Communications it has been reported that fiber to the premises projects in those markets will be renamed as "FAST", (short for Fiber Access Speed Technology.)[14]

Verizon FiOS products are delivered over the FTTP (Fiber To The Premise) network using passive optical network (PON) technology. Voice, video, and data travel over three wavelengths in the infrared spectrum. To serve a home, a single-mode optical fiber extends from an optical line terminal (OLT) at a FiOS central office or head end out to the neighborhoods where an optical splitter fans out the same signal on up to 32 fibers â€“ thus serving up to 32 subscribers. At the subscriber's home, an optical network terminal (ONT) transfers data onto the corresponding copper wiring for phone, video and Internet access.[15] FiOS TV service is broadcast from two Super Head ends to local Video Hub Offices (VHO) which insert local news and regional sports channels. The ONT then modulates the optical wavelengths into a RF signal.
One of the three wavelength bands is devoted to carrying television channels that are compatible with Cable television products. The other two wavelengths are devoted to all other data, one for outbound and the other for inbound data. This includes IPTV video, telephone and Internet data.
This allocation of wavelengths adheres to the ITU-T G.983 standard, also known as APON or BPON. Verizon initially installed slower BPONs but now only installs gigabit PONs (GPON) specified in the ITU-T G.984 standard. These bands and speeds are:
Unlike AT&T's U-verse product, Verizon's video service is not Video over IP (IPTV). Video On Demand (VOD) content and interactive features, such as Widgets and Programing Guide data, are delivered over IP. However, the vast majority of content, including Pay Per View (PPV), is provided over a standard broadcast video signal which carries both analog and digital content up to 870 MHz. This broadcast content originates from a traditional cable head end that combines analog channels with digital QAM channels and travels over a various SONET networks and eventually arrives at a local serving office. The RF signal occupies 870 MHz and is modulated onto the 1550 nm wavelength. The optical Video signal at 1550 nm is then coupled with the IP Data signal at 1490 nm via the use of a Wavelength-division multiplexer (WDM) and is sent out to the PON. The WDM also directs the incoming 1310 nm return from the ONT back to the OLT. At the ONT located at the subscriber's home, the RF video is sent over a coax connection most typically to an FiOS hybrid set-top box that handles both RF and IPTV video. The ONT provides Internet connectivity via an RJ45 connector, but also transfers IPTV video and internet IP packets onto coax using a 1.1 GHz channel to provide 100 Mbit/s of bandwidth as specified by the MoCA standard. Alternately, analog video may be played by any cable ready device, and traditional digital video may be accessed by any CableCARD certified television or digital video recorder such as a Tivo Series 3. However, interactive services such as VOD and Widgets are delivered by IP and are only accessible through use of one of FiOS's hybrid set top boxes manufactured by Motorola to support RF as well as the IPTV video. Verizon utilizes an IP return path from the Set Top Box (STB) so that subscribers may order PPV events, however users may call and order over the phone, then tune to a specified channel (starting at 701) to watch this content. The FiOS STBs play IPTV only from FiOS delivered via MoCA and not from video sources on the Internet. FiOS's IPTV implementation does not follow cable television formats and conventions for two way television and instead follows the DVB standard.[16]
MoCA is also used by FiOS for streaming video from the FiOS "media hub" for the home, a role currently filled by Motorola's QIP6416 hybrid QAM/IPTV digital video recorder (DVR). There are several limitations to video connectivity in the home via FiOS. Standard definition (SD) resolution video may be streamed to any television, but High definition (HD) content may only be streamed to other HD equipment. Network transfers of shows between DVRs is not allowed, but the currently-issued DVRs include a USB port for external media backup. Transfers to DTCP ("5C") compliant devices via firewire is possible, but nearly all digital content except ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC and locals are flagged via CGMS-D as "copy once" and so may not be transferred.
Most of the optical network terminals (ONT) being deployed by Verizon are Tellabs 1600 series ONT. This ONT provides up to four provisionable voice telephone ports, a 10/100/1000 Mbit/s Ethernet interface for data traffic, and one coaxial connector for CATV services. The Motorola ONT1000V is increasingly used on the west coast but is being supplanted as of September, 2008[update] by the Motorola ONT1000M ONT's, which are MoCA capable.
Verizon includes the Actiontec MI424-WR coax-enabled broadband home wireless-G router with installation of the service. This device is used for both FiOS TV and FiOS Internet. Verizon initially used the D-Link DI-604 and DI-624 routers but switched to a Verizon-cobranded model of the Actiontec MI424-WR for the added MoCA capabilities. Before the introduction of the MI424-WR, Verizon used the Motorola NIM100 for MoCA functionality.

Although Verizon's FiOS offers service at rates faster than ordinary cable and DSL connections, its price is one of the barriers to make it more popular. As of March 2009, it charges from $50 per month for a connection reaching up to 10 megabits per second to $145 per month for a connection reaching up to 50 megabits per second. Its price is more expensive than AT&Tâ€™s fastest DSL ($35 per month for 6 megabits per second, as of March 2009) and Time Warnerâ€™s cable internet service ($45 per month for 10 megabits per second, as of March 2009).
FiOS availability is still in infancy but growing steadily. As of December 2008, 10% of the Verizon customers ( around 4.4 million in 16 states ) using various FiOS based services.
