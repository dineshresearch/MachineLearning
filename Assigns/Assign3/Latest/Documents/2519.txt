Tax revenue as % of GDP
This table lists countries by total tax revenues (for all levels of government; i.e., federal, state, and local for the United States) as a percentage of GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Some of the main sources for the data are the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development),[1] and EUROSTAT (Statistical Office of the European Communities).[2]

The table entries are in alphabetical order in order to make it easy to quickly find specific countries. Also, it makes it much easier to update the numbers since there is no need for reordering.
The table can be put in ascending or descending rank order by clicking the arrow at the top of the column labeled "Tax in % of GDP."
