Dominican Republic
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: Rep√∫blica Dominicana; Spanish pronunciation: [reÀàpuŒ≤lika √∞ominiÀàkana]) is a nation on the island of Hispaniola, part of the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region. The western third of the island is occupied by the nation of Haiti, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands that are occupied by two countries, Saint Martin being the other. Both by area and population, the Dominican Republic is the second largest Caribbean island nation (after Cuba), with 48,442†km¬≤ and an estimated 9.5 million people.[5][6]
Inhabited by Ta√≠nos since the 7th century, the Dominican Republic was reached by Christopher Columbus in 1492 and became the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas, namely Santo Domingo, the country's capital and Spain's first capital in the New World. In Santo Domingo stand, among other firsts in the Americas, the first university, cathedral, and castle, the latter two in the Ciudad Colonial area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[9][5]
After three centuries of Spanish rule, with French and Haitian interludes, the country became independent in 1821 but was quickly taken over by Haiti. It attained independence in 1844, but mostly suffered political turmoil and tyranny, and as well a brief return to Spanish rule, over the next 72 years. United States occupation 1916-24 and a subsequent, calm 6‚Äìyear period were followed by the military dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina to 1961. The last civil war, in 1965, ended with U.S. intervention, followed by the authoritarian rule of Joaquin Balaguer, to 1978. Since 1978, the Dominican Republic has moved strongly toward representative democracy.[4]
The Dominican Republic has also adopted a liberal economic model, which has made it perhaps the largest economy in the region.[10][11] Though long known for sugar production, the economy is now dominated by services.[4] The country's economic progress is exemplified by its advanced telecommunication system.[12] Nevertheless, unemployment,[4] government corruption, income maldistribution,[4] and inconsistent electric service remain major Dominican problems.
Migration is a major issue affecting the D.R., as there are large flows of migrants to and from the country. Haitian immigration and the integration of Dominicans of Haitian descent are major issues in the Dominican Republic. The total population of Haitian origin is estimated at 800,000.[13] A large Dominican diaspora exists, most of it in the United States, where it comprises 1.2 million.[14] They contribute to the development of the Dominican Republic, as they send billions of dollars to the D.R., amounting to one-tenth of the GDP.[4][11]
The Dominican Republic has become the Caribbean's leading tourist destination; the country's year‚Äìround golf courses are among the top attractions.[12] In this mountainous country is located the Caribbean's highest mountain, Pico Duarte, as is Lake Enriquillo, the Caribbean's largest lake. Quisqueya, as Dominicans often call their country, has a mild average temperature (26 ¬∞C) and is outstanding for its great biological diversity.[12]
Music and sport are of the highest importance in Dominican culture, with merengue and baseball preferred.


The inhabitants of Hispaniola were displaced by the Ta√≠nos, an Arawakan-speaking people, circa A.D. 600.[15] The Ta√≠nos called the island Kiskeya or Quisqueya, meaning "mother of the earth", as well as Hait√≠ or Ayt√≠, and Bohio.[16] They engaged in farming and fishing,[17] and hunting and gathering.[15] There are widely varying estimates of the population of Hispaniola in 1492, including one hundred thousand,[18] three hundred thousand,[15] and 400,000 to 2 million.[19] By 1492 the island was divided into five chiefdoms.[20]
Within a few years following the arrival of Europeans the population of Ta√≠nos had declined drastically, due to changes in lifestyle, smallpox and other diseases that arrived with the Europeans, and enslavement. By 1711 the Ta√≠no numbered just 21,000.[21] The last record of pure Ta√≠no natives in the country was from an 1864 account by a Spanish soldier during the Restoration War, who wrote of Ta√≠nos shooting at Spanish soldiers and fleeing. Ta√≠no cave paintings can still be seen in a variety of caves around the country.[22] Remnants of the Taino culture still live on. Their designs of ancient pottery are still used today by skilled ceramic artisans in the small artisan village of Hig√ºerito, Moca.

Christopher Columbus landed at M√¥le Saint-Nicolas, in northwest present-day Haiti, on December 6, 1492, during his first voyage. He claimed the island for Spain and named it La Espa√±ola. Eighteen days later his flagship the Santa Mar√≠a ran aground near the present site of Cap-Haitien. Columbus was forced to leave 39 men, who built a fort named La Navidad (Christmas, or The Nativity). He then sailed east, exploring the northern coast of what is now the Dominican Republic, after which he returned to Spain. He sailed back to America three more times, and was buried in Santo Domingo upon his death in 1506.
After initially friendly relations, the Ta√≠nos resisted the conquest. One of the earliest leaders to fight against the Spanish was the female Chief Anacaona of Xaragua, in the southwest, who married Chief Caonabo of Maguana, of the center and south of the island. She was captured by the Spanish and executed in front of her people. Other notables who resisted include Chief Guacanagari, Chief Guam√°, and Chief Hatuey, the latter of whom later fled to Cuba and helped fight the Spaniards there. Chief Enriquillo fought victoriously against the Spanish in the Baoruco Mountain Range, in the southwest, to gain freedom for himself and his people in a part of the island for a time.
By the late 1500s, the majority of Ta√≠no people had died from European infectious diseases to which they had no immunity, from mistreatment, suicide, the breakup of family unity, starvation,[15] forced labor, torture, and war with the Spaniards. Most scholars now believe that, among the various contributing factors, infectious disease was the overwhelming cause of the Ta√≠no population decline.[23] The Ta√≠no survived mostly in racially mixed form, and today most Dominicans have Ta√≠no ancestry.[24][25]
Some scholars believe that Bartolom√© de las Casas exaggerated[26] the Indian population decline in an effort to persuade King Carlos to intervene, and that encomenderos also exaggerated it, in order to receive permission to import more African slaves. Moreover, censuses of the time did not account for the number of Indians who fled into remote communities,[24] where they often joined with runaway Africans, called cimarrones, producing zambos. There were also confusing issues with racial categorization, as Mestizos who were culturally Spanish were counted as Spaniards. In addition some Zambos were categorized as black and some Indians as Mulattos.[24]
In 1496 Bartholomew Columbus, Christopher's brother, built the city of Nueva Isabela (New Isabella), now Santo Domingo, in the south of Hispaniola. It was one of the first Spanish settlements (the previous ones had also been on Hispaniola), and became Europe's first permanent settlement in the "New World".
The Spaniards created a plantation economy on Hispaniola, particularly from the second half of the 16th century.[18] The island became a springboard for European conquest of the Caribbean islands, called Las Antillas (The Antilles), and soon after, the American mainland.
For decades, Santo Domingo was the headquarters of Spanish colonial power in the New World. But after the Spanish conquest of the mainland empires of the Aztecs and Incas, the importance of Hispaniola declined and Spain paid less attention to it. French bucaneers settled in the western part of the island, and by the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick, Spain ceded the area to France. With colonial settlement and the development of a plantation economy dependent on slave labor, it grew into the wealthy colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), with four times (500,000 vs. 125,000) as much population as Spanish Santo Domingo by the end of the 18th century. By then, enslaved Africans in Saint-Domingue outnumbered whites and freedmen by nine to one.[27]

France came to own the whole island in 1795, when by the Peace of Basel Spain ceded Santo Domingo as a consequence of the French Revolutionary Wars. At the time, Saint‚ÄìDomingue's slaves, led by Toussaint Louverture, were in revolt against France. In 1801 Toussaint Louverture captured Santo Domingo from the French, thus gaining control of the entire island.
In 1802 an army sent by Napoleon captured Toussaint Louverture and sent him to France as prisoner. However, Toussaint Louverture's successors, and yellow fever, succeeded in expelling the French again from Saint-Domingue. There the rebels declared the independence of Haiti in 1804, while to the east, France continued to rule Spanish Santo Domingo.
In 1808, following Napoleon's invasion of Spain, the criollos of Santo Domingo revolted against French rule and, with the aid of Great Britain (Spain's ally) and Haiti,[28] returned Santo Domingo to Spanish control.[29]
