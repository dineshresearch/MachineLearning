2006 Atlantic hurricane season
The 2006 Atlantic hurricane season officially ran from June 1 to November 30, 2006. It was much less active than the previous season, was the first since 2001 in which no hurricanes made landfall in the United States, and was the first since 1994 that no tropical cyclones formed during October.[1]
Following the intense activity of 2005, forecasters predicted that the 2006 season would be only slightly less active. But activity was slowed by a rapidly forming El NiÃ±o event in 2006, the presence of the Saharan Air Layer over the tropical Atlantic, and the steady presence of a robust secondary high pressure area to the Azores high centered around Bermuda. There were no tropical cyclones after October 2.[2]
Tropical Storm Alberto was indirectly responsible for two deaths when it made landfall in Florida. Hurricane Ernesto caused heavy rainfall in Haiti, and directly killed at least seven in Haiti and the United States. Four hurricanes formed after Ernesto, including the strongest storms of the season, Hurricanes Helene and Gordon. In total, the season was responsible for 14 deaths and $500 million (2006 USD) in damage. The calendar year 2006 also saw Tropical Storm Zeta, which arose in December 2005 and persisted until early January, only the second such event on record. The storm can be considered a part of the 2005 and 2006 seasons, although it occurred outside the June 1â€“November 30 windows during which most Atlantic basin tropical cyclones form.

Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts Philip J. Klotzbach, Dr. William M. Gray, and their associates at Colorado State University; and separately by NOAA forecasters.
Klotzbach's team (formerly led by Gray) has defined the average number of storms per season (1950â€“2000) as 9.6 tropical storms, 5.9 hurricanes, and 2.3 major hurricanes (storms exceeding Category 3 strength in the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale). A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 6â€“14 named storms, with 4â€“8 of those reaching hurricane strength, and 1â€“3 major hurricanes.[3][4]

On December 5, 2005, Klotzbach's team issued its initial extended-range forecast for the 2006 season, predicting an above average of 17 named storms, nine of them hurricanes, and five classified as Category 3 intensity or higher.[3]
As in the 2005 season, the team predicted it was highly probable that at least one major hurricane would directly impact the United States. The forecast suggested an 81% probability that at least one major hurricane would strike the U.S. mainland, a 64% chance of at least one major hurricane striking the East Coast of the United States (including the Florida peninsula), and a 47% chance of at least one major hurricane striking the Gulf Coast of the United States from the Florida Panhandle westward. The team also predicted that the potential for major hurricane activity in the Caribbean was above average. A few months later, on April 4, 2006, CSU issued another forecast confirming its December predictions.[6]
On May 22, 2006, NOAA released its pre-season forecast for the 2006 season. The prediction was for 13â€“16 named storms, 8â€“10 of those becoming hurricanes, and 4â€“6 becoming major hurricanes.[7]
On May 31, 2006, Klotzbach's team released its final pre-season forecast for 2006, confirming its earlier prediction.[8]

On August 3, 2006, Klotzbach's team lowered its season estimate to 15 named storms, with 7 becoming hurricanes and 3 becoming major hurricanes, noting that conditions had become less favorable for storms than they had been earlier in the year. The sea-level pressure and trade wind strength in the tropical Atlantic were reported to be above normal, while sea surface temperature anomalies were on a decreasing trend.[9]
On August 8, 2006, NOAA revised its season estimate to 12â€“15 named storms, with 7â€“9 becoming hurricanes and 3â€“4 becoming major hurricanes. The reduction was attributed to less favorable environmental conditions, a decrease in La NiÃ±a conditions, and the lack of a "very persistent upper-level ridge pattern over the eastern U.S. and western Atlantic."[10]
On September 1, Klotzbach's team also revised its season estimate, to 13 named storms, 5 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes, citing a larger volume of the Saharan Air Layer and an El NiÃ±o trend in the Pacific.[11] The team again reduced the number of tropical storms expected for the season a month later, on October 3, with an updated forecast of 11 named storms, 6  hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes, citing the ongoing El NiÃ±o.[12]














Tropical Storm Zeta formed on December 30, 2005, and lasted until January 6, 2006.[13] Although the majority of its existence was spent in 2006, it is officially a storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, because it formed in 2005. Zeta joined Hurricane Alice as only the second Atlantic tropical cyclone in recorded history to span two calendar years.[13]

The official start of the Atlantic hurricane season is June 1,[14] which is just before Tropical Storm Alberto developed on June 10 in the northwestern Caribbean. It tracked northeastward through the Gulf of Mexico, reaching an intensity of 70 mph (110 km/h) on June 13 before making landfall near Adams Beach, Florida, on June 14.[15] Losing its tropical characteristics, Alberto moved northward and produced heavy rainfall in South Carolina and North Carolina. The remnants tracked off the East Coast and transitioned into a powerful extratropical storm which affected Nova Scotia with high winds, heavy rain, and rough surf, leaving four fisherman missing offshore.[15] Alberto caused record rainfall in North Carolina, peaking at 8 inches (200 mm).[16] In Florida, two people died,[17] and damage estimated at $250,000 (2006 USD) was caused.[18]
On July 17, a cold front moved off the Northeast United States coast and stalled; the tail end of the front spawned a low pressure system which tracked to the northeast along the front. Convection increased for a short time, before reaching colder waters and dissipating. Although the system was not believed to be tropical during its existence, post-season analysis revealed that it had attained tropical characteristics for 30 hours, and so it was designated an unnamed tropical storm.[19]
A frontal system moved off the North Carolina coast and spawned a low pressure system east of North Carolina on July 18. Associated with deep convection, the storm organized sufficiently to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Beryl on July 19. It tracked northeast and passed over Nantucket before dissipating on July 21, having had no major effects on land.[20]

By late July, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and traversed the Atlantic Ocean. The associated convection organized, and became a tropical depression on July 31. The depression tracked westward and soon intensified into Tropical Storm Chris before reaching peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h), just before weakening and passing over Cuba as a tropical depression. The storm's effects were limited to moderate rainfall in Hispaniola and Cuba.[21]
On August 20, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa associated with deep convection. The next day, it spanwed a system which was classified as a tropical depression while situated south of Cape Verde. On August 22, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Debby. Debby passed south of the Cape Verde Islands and reached peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h) before turning north and dissipating without affecting any land masses.[22]
Hurricane Ernesto originated from a tropical wave which moved off the coast of Africa on August 18. The wave progressed westward and reached the Western Atlantic, spawning a tropical depression on August 24. On August 25 the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Ernesto, and the storm was briefly upgraded to a hurricane before striking Florida as a weak tropical storm. Ernesto moved off the U.S. East Coast and made a second landfall on North Carolina before moving inland and dissipating over Canada.[23] Overall, the storm caused $500 million (2006 USD) in the United States[24] and killed at least eleven people, five of them in the United States, and five in Haiti.[23]

Hurricane Florence originated on September 3 from the complex merging of two tropical waves, creating one large low pressure area. The disturbance moved westward and became a tropical depression in the open waters of the Atlantic. On September 5, it organized further and was upgraded into Tropical Storm Florence. Florence tracked west-northwest and intensified into a hurricane on September 10 while south of Bermuda. The storm passed just to the east of Bermuda as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale as it reached its peak intensity of 90 mph (145 km/h). It moved north before losing its tropical characteristics and passing over the Canadian Maritimes as a strong extratropical storm.[25] Florence affected Bermuda with wind gusts up to 115 mph (185 km/h) and heavy rain which left 23,000 houses without electricity. In all, the storm caused $200,000 (2006 USD) in damage.[26]
A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 1. The wave tracked westward across the Atlantic for several days until it reached an area of relaxed wind shear and its associated low pressure area organized into a tropical depression. It moved east-northeast and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gordon on September 11, while located over the open waters of the Atlantic. Gordon turned north, and became a hurricane on September 13. It intensified to Category 3 status on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale and reached its peak intensity of 120 mph (195 km/h) on September 14. Tracking northward, it began to lose tropical characteristics. On September 20, the system affected Britain with high winds and heavy rain as an extratropical cyclone.[27] During Gordon's passage through Britain, 120,000 homes were left without power after winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) affected the country.[28]
On September 11, a vigorous tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa. The wave organized rapidly and spawned a tropical depression to the south-southeast of Cape Verde. On September 14, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Helene while tracking west-northwest. Helene continued to intensify and was upgraded to a hurricane on September 16. The storm began to execute a northward track, and reached Category 3 hurricane status on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale on September 18, before reaching its peak intensity of 120 mph (195 km/h). It started to weaken when it reached the cold waters of the North Atlantic, and Helene dissipated on September 20, without having had major effects on land other than moderate wind gusts in the British Isles.[29]
Hurricane Isaac originated in a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on September 18. The wave tracked west, produced a tropical depression, and became a tropical storm on September 28. Isaac moved north-northwest and was upgraded to a hurricane on September 30. It turned north and reached its peak intensity of 85 mph (135 km/h) before weakening and brushing Nova Scotia.[30] Isaac did not affect any land or shipping lanes.[30]

Compared to the previous 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, 2006 was not severe in terms of deaths and damage. The season was unusual in that no hurricanes made landfall in the United States, the first such occurrence since 2001.[31] However, three tropical storms made landfall in the United States; the first of them, Tropical Storm Alberto, made landfall in Florida with winds of 50 mph (80 km/h).[15] The storm moved inland, and produced 6â€“7 inches (150â€“175 mm) of rain in the area of landfall, and in North Carolina.[32] A total of three indirect deaths resulted from the storm.[33] Tropical Storm Beryl made landfall on Nantucket, causing little or no damage. It generated high waves along the East Coast of the United States, with 19-foot (6 m) seas in the open ocean.[34] The third and more significant storm was Hurricane Ernesto, which killed two people in Virginia.[23] Ernesto made landfall in the Florida Keys, and later made landfall in Miami-Dade county.[35] It moved north and dissipated over
