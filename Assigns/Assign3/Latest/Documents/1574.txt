US Airways Flight 1549
US Airways Flight 1549 was a scheduled commercial passenger flight from New York City to Charlotte, North Carolina, that, on January 15, 2009, ditched in the Hudson River adjacent to Manhattan six minutes after departing from LaGuardia Airport.[3][4][5]
While on its initial climb out, the Airbus A320 struck a flock of Canada Geese which resulted in an immediate almost complete loss of thrust from both engines. When the aircrew determined that the plane would be unable to safely reach any airfield from its location just northeast of the George Washington Bridge, they turned it southbound and glided over the river, then ditched the airliner virtually intact near the USS Intrepid Museum in midtown Manhattan. After the 155 occupants safely evacuated the partially submerged and sinking plane they were all rescued by nearby watercraft.[6][7][8][9][10][11]
The entire crew of Flight 1549 was later awarded the Master's Medal of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators. The award citation read, "This emergency ditching and evacuation, with the loss of no lives, is a heroic and unique aviation achievement."[12]

US Airways Flight 1549 (also designated under a Star Alliance codeshare agreement as United Airlines Flight 1919) was a domestic route from New York City's LaGuardia Airport (LGA) to Charlotte/Douglas, North Carolina, with direct onward service to Seattle-Tacoma in Washington.
On January 15, 2009, the flight was cleared for takeoff from Runway 4 at LaGuardia at 3:24:56 p.m. EST (20:24:56 UTC). The crew made their first report after becoming airborne at 3:25:51 as being at 700 feet and climbing.[13] There were 150 passengers and five crew members, including the captain, first officer, and three flight attendants, on board.[1][14]
The captain was Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger, 57, a former fighter pilot who had been an airline pilot since leaving the Air Force in 1980. He is also a safety expert and a glider pilot.[15][16][17][18][19] The first officer was Jeffrey B. Skiles, 49,[17][20][21] who was on his first flight in the Airbus A320 since passing the training course to fly the type.[22] The flight attendants were Donna Dent,[23] Doreen Welsh, and Sheila Dail.[24]
As is often the case when a regularly scheduled commercial flight is involved in an accident, use of the flight's number, 1549, was discontinued for subsequent operations of the carrier's afternoon LGA-CLT-SEA service. On January 16, 2009, the route was redesignated US Airways Flight 1543, and on February 12, 2009, the LGA-CLT leg became Flight 1867 when its equipment was changed to an Airbus A321.[25]

The aircraft was an Airbus A320-214 (Registration: N106US), powered by two GE Aviation/Snecma-designed CFM56-5B4/P engines manufactured in France and the U.S.[26] One of 74 A320s then in service in the US Airways fleet,[27] it was built by Airbus Industrie with final assembly at its facility at AÃ©roport de Toulouse-Blagnac in France in June, 1999. Delivered to the carrier on August 2, 1999, the airliner was registered to Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, NA, as owner/lessor[28] with AIG listed as the lead insurer.[29]
The aircraft's FAA-required maintenance records[30] released by US Airways the day after the accident showed that when N106US was written off its airframe had logged 16,299 cycles (flights) totaling 25,241.08 flight hours. Total time on the engines was 19,182 hours on the left (#1) and 26,466 hours on the right (#2). The last A Check, a maintenance check performed every 550 flight hours, was passed on December 6, 2008, and the last C Check (annual comprehensive inspection) on April 19, 2008. [26]
The Airbus A320 is a digital fly-by-wire aircraft; the flight control surfaces are moved by electrical and hydraulic actuators controlled by a digital computer. The computer determines its commands via input from the pilot through a side-stick, but also makes adjustments on its own to keep the plane stable and on course.
The mechanical energy of the two engines is the primary source of routine electrical power and hydraulic pressure for the aircraft flight control systems.[31] The aircraft also has an auxiliary power unit (APU), which can provide backup electrical power for the aircraft, including its electrically powered hydraulic pumps; and a ram air turbine (RAT), a type of wind turbine that can be deployed into the airstream to provide backup hydraulic pressure and electrical power at certain speeds.[31] According to the NTSB, both the APU and the RAT were operating as the plane descended into the Hudson, although it was not clear whether the RAT had been deployed manually or automatically.[31]
The Airbus A320 also has a "ditching" button that closes valves and openings underneath the aircraft including the outflow valve, the air inlet for the emergency Ram Air Turbine, avionics inlet, extract valve and flow control valve. It is meant to slow flooding in a water landing.[32] The flight crew did not activate the "ditch switch" during the incident.[33]

First Officer Skiles was at the controls of the flight when it took off to the northeast from Runway 4 at 3:25 p.m., and was the first to notice a formation of birds approaching the aircraft about two minutes later while passing through an altitude of about 3,200 feet (980 m)[3] on its initial climb out to 15,000 feet.[34] The aircraft collided with the birds at 3:27:01.[35] The windscreen quickly turned dark brown and several loud thuds were heard.[36] Both engines ingested birds and immediately lost almost all thrust.[34] Capt. Sullenberger took the controls, while Skiles attempted to restart the engines and began going through a three-page emergency procedures checklist.[34]
At 3:27:36,[35] using the call sign "Cactus 1539  [sic]",[37][38] the flight radioed air traffic controllers at New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON)[39] "Hit birds. We lost thrust in both engines. Returning back towards LaGuardia." Passengers and cabin crew later reported hearing "very loud bangs" in both engines and seeing flaming exhaust, then silence from the engines and smelling the odor of unburned fuel in the cabin.[8][40][41] Responding to the captain's report of a bird strike, controller Patrick Harten[42] gave the flight a heading to return to LaGuardia and told him that he could land to the southeast on Runway 13.[39] Sullenberger responded that he was unable.[39]
Sullenberger asked if they could attempt an emergency landing in New Jersey, mentioning Teterboro Airport in Bergen County as a possibility;[43][39][44] air traffic controllers quickly contacted Teterboro and gained permission for a landing on runway 1.[43] However, Sullenberger told controllers that "We can't do it",[34] and that "We're gonna be in the Hudson," making clear his intention to bring the plane down on the Hudson River due to a lack of altitude.[45] Air traffic control at LaGuardia reported seeing the aircraft pass less than 900 feet (270 m) above the George Washington Bridge.[46] About 90 seconds before touchdown, the captain announced, "Brace for impact,"[46] and the flight attendants instructed the passengers how to do so.[47]
The plane ended its six-minute flight at 3:31 pm with an unpowered ditching while heading south at about 150 miles per hour (130 kn; 240 km/h) in the middle of the North River section of the Hudson River roughly abeam 50th Street (near the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum) in Manhattan and Port Imperial in Weehawken, New Jersey. Sullenberger said in an interview on CBS television that his training prompted him to choose a ditching location near operating boats so as to maximize the chance of rescue. The location was near three boat terminals: two used by ferry operator NY Waterway on either side of the Hudson River and a third used by tour boat operator Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises.[13][48] The ditching location was approximately 40Â°46â€²10â€³N 74Â°00â€²17â€³Wï»¿ / ï»¿40.769498Â°N 74.004636Â°Wï»¿ / 40.769498; -74.004636Coordinates: 40Â°46â€²10â€³N 74Â°00â€²17â€³Wï»¿ / ï»¿40.769498Â°N 74.004636Â°Wï»¿ / 40.769498; -74.004636.[49] After coming to a stop in the river, the plane began drifting southward with the current.[50]
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Board Member Kitty Higgins, the principal spokesperson for the on-scene investigation, said at a press conference the day after the accident that it "has to go down [as] the most successful ditching in aviation history."[51] "These people knew what they were supposed to do and they did it and as a result, nobody lost their life."[52]

Immediately after the A320 had been ditched in mid-river, the aircrew began evacuating the 150 passengers both on to the wings through from the four mid-cabin emergency window exits and into inflated slides deployed from the two front passenger doors while the partially submerged and slowly sinking airliner drifted down the river with the current. Two flight attendants were in the front, one in the rear. Each flight attendant in the front opened a door which was also armed to activate a slide although the one on the port side did not immediately deploy. One rear door was opened by a panicked passenger causing the aircraft to fill more quickly with water. The flight attendant in the rear who attempted to reseal the rear door was not successful in doing so, she told CBS News.[53] It was later revealed the impact with the water had ripped open a hole in the underside of the airplane and twisting of the fuselage caused cargo doors to pop open, filling the plane with water from the rear from this damage.[54] The flight attendant also urged passengers to move forward by climbing over seats to escape the rising water within the cabin. One passenger was in a wheelchair. Having twice walked the length of the cabin to confirm that no one remained inside after the plane had been evacuated, the captain was the last person to leave the aircraft.[48][55][56][57] Evacuees, some wearing life-vests, waited for rescue on the partly submerged slides, knee-deep in icy river water. Others stood on the wings or, fearing an explosion, swam away from the plane.[53] Air temperature at the time was about 20 Â°F (âˆ’7 Â°C), and the water was 36 Â°F (2 Â°C)[44].
