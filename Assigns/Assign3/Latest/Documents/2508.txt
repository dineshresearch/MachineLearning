Tumblelog
A tumblelog is a variation of a blog that favors short-form, mixed-media posts over the longer editorial posts frequently associated with blogging. Common post formats found on tumblelogs include links, photos, quotes, dialogues, and video. Unlike blogs, tumblelogs are frequently used to share the author's creations, discoveries, or experiences while providing little or no commentary.
The term tumblelog was coined by why the lucky stiff in a blog post on April 12, 2005, while describing Christian Neukirchen's Anarchaia.
Jason Kottke described tumblelogs on October 19, 2005:[1]

Most tumblelogs act as compilations of links and online discoveries. However, it is becoming more popular for tumbleloggers to use their blogs for artistic and creative endeavors. The short manner of tumblelogs makes it simple for artists to showcase new photos or artwork.
