The stock grew considerably after Mitsubishi UFJ closed the deal to buy 21% of Morgan Stanley on October 14, 2008.

Morgan Stanley can trace its roots in the history of J.P. Morgan & Co. Following the Glass-Steagall Act, it became no longer possible for a corporation to have investment banking and retail banking businesses under a single holding entity. J.P. Morgan & Co. chose the retail banking business over the investment banking business. As a result, some of the employees of J.P. Morgan & Co., most notably Henry S. Morgan and Harold Stanley, left J.P. Morgan & Co. and joined some others from the Drexel partners to form Morgan Stanley. The firm formally opened the doors for business on September 16, 1935, at Floor 19, 2 Wall Street, New York City. Within its first year, it achieved 24% market share (US$1.1 billion) among public offerings. The firm was involved with the distribution of 1938 US$100 million of debentures for the United States Steel Corporation as the lead underwriter. The firm also obtained the distinction of being the lead syndicate in the 1939 U.S. rail financing. The firm went through a major reorganization in 1941 to allow for more activity in its securities business.[9]

The firm was led by Perry Hall, the last founder to lead Morgan Stanley, from 1951â€“1961. During this period the firm co-managed the famous World Bank's US$50 million triple-A-rated bonds offering of 1952. The firm, in this period, also came up with the General Motor's US$300 million debt issue, US$231 million IBM stock offering, the US$250 million AT&T's debt offering[10].
In 1962, Morgan Stanley credits itself with having created the first viable computer model for financial analysis[11], thereby starting a new trend in the field of financial analysis. In 1967 it established the Morgan & Cie, International in Paris in attempt to enter the European securities market. It acquired Brooks, Harvey & Co., Inc. in 1967 and established a presence in the real estate business. By 1971 the firm had established its Mergers & Acquisitions business along with Sales & Trading. The sales and trading business is believed to be the brainchild of Bob Baldwin[12]. In 1970 Morgan Stanley opened a representative office in Tokyo and formally entered the Japanese markets. In 1975 Morgan Stanley established Morgan Stanley International Inc. in London. The private wealth management department was added into the firm's business units by 1977 when Morgan Stanley established Morgan Stanley Realty Inc. In the same year Morgan Stanley merged with Shuman, Agnew & Co. Morgan Stanley lead the Apple common stock IPO on December 12, 1980. The firm entered the Prime Brokerage business in 1984. In 1986, Morgan Stanley Group, Inc., was publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange. By 1990 Morgan Stanley had its regional offices in Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Melbourne, Milan, Sydney and ZÃ¼rich and had regional headquarters in London and Tokyo.

In 1996, Morgan Stanley acquired Van Kampen American Capital. On February 5, 1997, the company merged with Dean Witter Reynolds, and Discover & Co. the spun-off financial services business of Sears Roebuck. The merged company was briefly known as "Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover & Co." until 1998 when it was known as "Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co." until late 2001. To foster brand recognition and marketing the Dean Witter name was dropped and the firm became "Morgan Stanley". Morgan Stanley acquired AB Asesores of Spain and entered India in a joint venture with JM Financials in 1999.
In 2001, Morgan Stanley lost thirteen employees in the September 11, 2001 attacks, but 2687 were successfully evacuated by Secrity Director Rick Rescorla, who was one of the thirteen lost; after the disaster, the surviving employees moved to temporary headquarters in the vicinity. In 2005, it moved 2,300 of its employees back to lower Manhattan, at that time the largest such move [13].
In 2004, Morgan Stanley co-managed the Google IPO which is the largest internet IPO in U.S. history. In the same year Morgan Stanley acquired the Canary Wharf Group. On December 19, 2006, after reporting 4th quarter earnings, Morgan Stanley announced the spin-off of its Discover Card unit.

In August 2008, Morgan Stanley was contracted by the United States Treasury to advise the government on potential rescue strategies for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac [15].
On September 17, 2008, the British evening-news analysis program Newsnight reported that Morgan Stanley was facing difficulties after a 42% slide in its share price. CEO John Mack wrote in a memo to staff "we're in the midst of a market controlled by fear and rumours and short-sellers are driving our stock down." The company was said to explore merger possibilities with CITIC, Wachovia, HSBC, Banco Santander and Nomura.[16]
On September 22, 2008, the last two bulge bracket investment banks in the US, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, both announced that they would become traditional bank holding companies, bringing an end to the era of investment banking on Wall Street. [17] The Federal Reserve's approval of their bid to become banks ends the ascendancy of the securities firms, 75 years after Congress separated them from deposit-taking lenders, and caps weeks of chaos that sent Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. into bankruptcy and led to the rushed sale of Merrill Lynch & Co. to Bank of America Corp. [18]

Morgan Stanley splits its businesses into three core business units. These follow below.

Institutional Securities has been the most profitable business segment[19] for Morgan Stanley in recent times. This business segment provides institutions with services such as capital raising and financial advisory services including advice on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, real estate and project finance, corporate lending etc. The segment also encompasses the Equities and the Fixed Income divisions of the firm.

Global Wealth Management Group provides brokerage and investment advisory services. As of 2008 Q1 this segment has reported an annual increase of 12 percent in the pre-tax income[20]. This segment provides financial and wealth planning services to its clients who are mainly high net worth individuals and hedge funds.

Asset Management provides global asset management products and services in equity, fixed income, alternative investments and private equity to institutional and retail clients through third-party retail distribution channels, intermediaries and Morgan Stanley's institutional distribution channel. Morgan Stanley's asset management activities are principally conducted under the Morgan Stanley and Van Kampen brands. It provides asset management products and services to institutional investors worldwide, including pension plans, corporations, private funds, non-profit organizations, foundations, endowments, governmental agencies, insurance companies and banks. As of 2008 Q1 the segment posted a pre-tax loss of US$161 million[21].


In 2003, Morgan Stanley agreed to pay billions of dollars in order to settle its portion of various legal actions and investigations brought by Eliott Spitzer, the Attorney General of New York, the National Association of Securities Dealers (Now FINRA), the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, (SEC) and a number of state securities regulators, relating to fraud that was allegedly perpetrated upon retail investors by a dozen of the largest investment banking securities brokerage firms.
On July 12, 2004, Morgan Stanley settled a sex discrimination suit brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for $54 million.[citation needed]
On January 12, 2005, The New York Stock Exchange imposed a $19 million fine on Morgan Stanley for alleged regulatory and supervisory lapses.[citation needed]
On May 16, 2005, a Florida jury found that Morgan Stanley did in fact fail to give adequate information to Ronald Perelman about Sunbeam thereby defrauding him and causing damages to him of $604 million. In addition, punitive damages were added for total damages of $1.450 billion. This verdict was directed by the judge as a sanction against Morgan Stanley after the firm's attorneys infuriated the court by failing and refusing to produce documents, and falsely telling the court that certain documents did not exist.[citation needed] On March 21, 2007, the ruling was overturned and Morgan Stanley was no longer required to pay the 1.57 billion dollar verdict. [24].
More recently, a class action lawsuit was filed in California by both current and former Morgan Stanley employees for unfair labor practices that were instituted to those employed through the financial advisor training program. A $40 million settlement was reportedly reached, with expected payout to those employed through the training program between specified dates.[citation needed]

On September 27, 2007, FINRA announced a $12.5 million settlement with Morgan Stanley to resolve charges that the firm's former affiliate, Morgan Stanley DW, Inc. (MSDW), failed on numerous occasions to provide e-mails to claimants in arbitration proceedings as well as to regulators - while representing that the destruction of the firm's email servers in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York's World Trade Center resulted in the loss of all pre-9/11 e-mail. In fact, the firm had millions of pre-9/11 e-mails that had been restored to the firm's active e-mail system using back-up tapes that had been stored in another location.[25] Customers who had lost their arbitration cases against Morgan Stanley DW Inc. because of their inability to obtain the emails to demonstrate Morgan Stanley's misconduct will each receive a token amount of money as a result of the settlement.
