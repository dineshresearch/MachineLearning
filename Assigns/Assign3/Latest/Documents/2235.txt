Titanium
Titanium (pronounced /ta…™Ààte…™ni…ôm/) is a chemical element with the symbol Ti and atomic number 22. Sometimes called the ‚Äúspace age metal‚Äù, it has a low density and is a strong, lustrous, corrosion-resistant (including to sea water, aqua regia and chlorine) transition metal with a silver color. Titanium can be alloyed with iron, aluminium, vanadium, molybdenum, among other elements, to produce strong lightweight alloys for aerospace (jet engines, missiles, and spacecraft), military, industrial process (chemicals and petro-chemicals, desalination plants, pulp, and paper), automotive, agri-food, medical prostheses, orthopedic implants, dental and endodontic instruments and files, dental implants, sporting goods, jewelry, mobile phones, and other applications.[1] Titanium was discovered in England by William Gregor in 1791 and named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth for the Titans of Greek mythology.
The element occurs within a number of mineral deposits, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere, and it is found in almost all living things, rocks, water bodies, and soils.[1] The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores via the Kroll process[2] or the Hunter process. Its most common compound, titanium dioxide, is used in the manufacture of white pigments.[3] Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) (used in smoke screens/skywriting and as a catalyst) and titanium trichloride (TiCl3) (used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene).[1]
The two most useful properties of the metal form are corrosion resistance, and the highest strength-to-weight ratio of any metal.[4] In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, but 45% lighter.[5] There are two allotropic forms[6] and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element; 46Ti through 50Ti, with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8%).[7] Titanium's properties are chemically and physically similar to zirconium.


A metallic element, titanium is recognized for its high strength-to-weight ratio.[6] It is a strong metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment),[8] lustrous, and metallic-white in color.[9] The relatively high melting point (over 1,649†¬∞C or 3,000†¬∞F) makes it useful as a refractory metal.
Commercial (99.2% pure) grades of titanium have ultimate tensile strength of about 63,000†psi (434†MPa), equal to that of some steel alloys, but are 45% lighter.[5] Titanium is 60% more dense than aluminium, but more than twice as strong[5] as the most commonly used 6061-T6 aluminium alloy. Titanium can be used for multiple reasons. Certain titanium alloys (e.g., Beta C) achieve tensile strengths of over 200,000†psi (1380†MPa).[10] However, titanium loses strength when heated above 430†¬∞C (800†¬∞F).[11]
It is fairly hard although not as hard as some grades of heat-treated steel, non-magnetic and a poor conductor of heat and electricity. Machining requires precautions, as the material will soften and gall if sharp tools and proper cooling methods are not used. Like those made from steel, titanium structures have a fatigue limit which guarantees longevity in some applications.[9]
The metal is a dimorphic allotrope with the hexagonal alpha form changing into the body-centered cubic (lattice) beta form at 882†¬∞C (1,619†¬∞F).[11] The specific heat of the alpha form increases dramatically as it is heated to this transition temperature but then falls and remains fairly constant for the beta form regardless of temperature.[11] Similar to zirconium and hafnium, an additional omega phase exists, which is thermodynamically stable at high pressures, but which may exist metastably at ambient pressures. This phase is usually hexagonal (ideal) or trigonal (distorted) and can be viewed as being due to a soft longitudinal acoustic phonon of the beta phase causing collapse of (111) planes of atoms.[12]

The most noted chemical property of titanium is its excellent resistance to corrosion; it is almost as resistant as platinum, capable of withstanding attack by acids, moist chlorine in water but is soluble in concentrated acids.[13]
While the following pourbaix diagram shows that titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal, it is slow to react with water and air.
This metal forms a passive and protective oxide coating (leading to increased corrosion-resistance) when exposed to elevated temperatures in air, but at room temperatures it resists tarnishing.[8] When it first forms, this protective layer is only 1‚Äì2†nm thick but continues to slowly grow; reaching a thickness of 25†nm in four years.[15]
Titanium burns in air when heated to 1200†¬∞C (2,200†¬∞F) and in pure oxygen when heated to 610†¬∞C (1,130†¬∞F) or higher, forming titanium dioxide.[6] This results in the fact that it is unable to melt the metal in open air as it burns before the melting point is reached, so melting is only possible in an inert atmosphere or in vacuum. It is also one of the few elements that burns in pure nitrogen gas (it burns at 800†¬∞C or 1,472†¬∞F and forms titanium nitride, which causes embrittlement).[16] Titanium is resistant to dilute sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid, along with chlorine gas, chloride solutions, and most organic acids.[2] It is paramagnetic weakly attracted to magnets and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity.[8]
Experiments have shown that natural titanium becomes radioactive after it is bombarded with deuterons, emitting mainly positrons and hard gamma rays.[2] When it is red hot the metal combines with oxygen, and when it reaches 550†¬∞C (1,022†¬∞F) it combines with chlorine.[2] It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.[3]

The +4 oxidation state dominates in titanium chemistry,[17] but compounds in the +3 oxidation state are also common.[18] Because of this high oxidation state, many titanium compounds have a high degree of covalent bonding.
Star sapphires and rubies get their asterism from the titanium dioxide impurities present in them.[15] Titanates are compounds made with titanium dioxide. Barium titanate has piezoelectric properties, thus making it possible to use it as a transducer in the interconversion of sound and electricity.[6] Esters of titanium are formed by the reaction of alcohols and titanium tetrachloride and are used to waterproof fabrics.[6]
Titanium nitride (TiN) is often used to coat cutting tools, such as drill bits.[19] It also finds use as a gold-colored decorative finish, and as a barrier metal in semiconductor fabrication.[20]
Titanium tetrachloride (titanium(IV) chloride, TiCl4, sometimes called "Tickle") is a colorless liquid which is used as an intermediate in the manufacture of titanium dioxide for paint.[21] It is widely used in organic chemistry as a Lewis acid, for example in the Mukaiyama aldol condensation.[22] Titanium also forms a lower chloride, titanium(III) chloride (TiCl3), which is used as a reducing agent.[23]
Titanocene dichloride is an important catalyst for carbon-carbon bond formation. Titanium isopropoxide is used for Sharpless epoxidation. Other compounds include titanium bromide (used in metallurgy, superalloys, and high-temperature electrical wiring and coatings) and titanium carbide (found in high-temperature cutting tools and coatings).[3]

Titanium is always bonded to other elements in nature. It is the ninth-most abundant element in the Earth's crust (0.63% by mass)[25] and the seventh-most abundant metal. It is present in most igneous rocks and in sediments derived from them (as well as in living things and natural bodies of water).[8][2] In fact, of the 801 types of igneous rocks analyzed by the United States Geological Survey, 784 contained titanium.[25] Its proportion in soils is approximately 0.5 to 1.5%.[25]
It is widely distributed and occurs primarily in the minerals anatase, brookite, ilmenite, perovskite, rutile, titanite (sphene), as well in many iron ores.[15] Of these minerals, only rutile and ilmenite have any economic importance, yet even they are difficult to find in high concentrations. Significant titanium-bearing ilmenite deposits exist in western Australia, Canada, China,
