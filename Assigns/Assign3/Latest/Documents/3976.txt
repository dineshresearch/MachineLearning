Gabriel
In Abrahamic religions, Gabriel (Hebrew: ◊í÷∑÷º◊ë÷∞◊®÷¥◊ô◊ê÷µ◊ú, Standard†Gavri ºel Tiberian†Ga·∏ár√Æ ºƒìl; Latin: Gabrielus; Greek: ŒìŒ±Œ≤œÅŒπŒÆŒª, Gabriƒìl; Arabic: ÿ¨ÿ®ÿ±ŸäŸÑ, Jibrƒ´l or ÿ¨ÿ®ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ŸäŸÑ Jibrail; Aramaic: Gabri-el, "strong man of God"[1]) is an angel who serves as a messenger from God. He first appears in the Book of Daniel in the Hebrew Bible. In some traditions he is regarded as one of the archangels, or as the angel of death. He is also known as Saint Gabriel to some Christian denominations.
Christians and Muslims believe him to have foretold the births of John the Baptist and Jesus. Islam further believes he was the medium through whom God revealed the Qur'an to Muhammad, and that he sent a message to most prophets, if not all, revealing their obligations. He is called the chief of the four favoured angels and the spirit of truth, and in some views Gabriel is the same as the Holy Spirit.[citation needed] Gabriel also finds mention in the writings of the Bah√°'√≠ Faith, most notably in Bah√°'u'll√°h's mystical work Seven Valleys.


According to the New Testament, Gabriel announces the birth of John the Baptist (Luke 1:5-20) and the birth of Jesus (Luke 1:26-38).

And so not any Angel, but the Archangel Gabriel, was sent to Mary; for this ministry, it was fitting to have the highest Angel, since he was to announce the greatest news of all. Gabriel was sent to Mary; he who is called "Strength of God" came to announce Him who deigned to appear in humility to conquer the powers of the air.

According to the non canonical Enoch 9:1-2 Gabriel, along with Michael, Raphael, Uriel and Suriel hear the cries of humanity under the strain of the Nephilim. It was their beseeching of 'the Ancient of Days' [Yahweh], that prompted God to call Enoch to prophethood.
After Enoch informed the Watchers of their fall from Grace, Yahweh sent the archangels to earth to complete various tasks. Gabriel was to 'Go to the biters, to the reprobates, to the children of fornication, the offspring of the Watchers, from among men; bring them forth and excite them against one another. Let them perish under mutual slaughter; for length of days shall not be theirs.' Enoch 10:13. And so, Gabriel instigated wars among the Giants (the children of the Watchers).
Enoch 20:7 says that Gabriel presides over 'Ikisat'. While Enoch 40:9 states that Gabriel presides over 'all that is powerful'.

The feast of Saint Gabriel was included for the first time in the General Roman Calendar in 1921, for celebration on March 24. In 1969 it was transferred to 29 September for celebration together with St. Michael and St. Raphael.[2] The Church of England has also adopted the 29 September date.
The Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite celebrate his feast day on 8 November (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 8 November currently falls on 21 November of the modern Gregorian Calendar, a difference of 13 days). Eastern Orthodox commemorate him, not only on his November feast, but also on two other days: 26 March is the "Synaxis of the Archangel Gabriel" and celebrates his role in the Annunciation. 13 July is also known as the "Synaxis of the Archangel Gabriel", and celebrates all the appearances and miracles attributed to Gabriel throughout history. The feast was first established on Mount Athos when, in the ninth century, during the reign of Emperor Basil II and the Empress Constantina Porphyrogenitus, while Nicholas II Chrysoberges|Nicholas Chrysoverges was Patriarch of Constantinople, the Archangel appeared in a cell near Karyes, where he wrote with his finger on a stone tablet the hymn to the Theotokos, "It is truly meet..." (see Axion Estin).[3]
The Ethiopian Church celebrates his feast on 28 December, with a sizeable number of its believers making a pilgrimage to a church dedicated to "Saint Gabriel" in Kulubi on that day.[4]
Additionally Gabriel is a the Patron saint of messengers, those who work for broadcasting and telecommunications such as radio and television, remote sensing, and postal workers.

In Latter-day Saint theology, Gabriel lived in this mortal life as the patriarch Noah. Gabriel and Noah are regarded as the same individual; Noah being his mortal name and Gabriel being his heavenly name.[5] See also: Noah, Michael (archangel) ~ Adam

The Arabic name for Gabriel is Jibril, Jibrƒ´l, Jibreel, Jabril√¶ or Djibril (ÿ¨ÿ®ÿ±ŸäŸÑ , ÿ¨ÿ®ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ŸäŸÑ, IPA:†[d íibr√¶Àê îiÀêl], [d íibr…õÃà îiÀêl], or [d íibriÀêl]) Muslims believe Gabriel to have been the angel who revealed the Qur'an to the prophet Muhammad.
Gabriel's physical appearance is described in the Hadith (4:54:4:55):
Na By Abu Ishaq-Ash-Shaibani: I asked Zir bin Hubaish regarding the Statement of God: "And was at a distance Of but two bow-lengths Or (even) nearer; So did (God) convey The Inspiration to His servant (Gabriel) and then he (Gabriel) Conveyed (that to Muhammad). ([Qur'an†53:9]) On that, Zir said, "Ibn Mas'ud informed us that the Prophet had seen Gabriel having 600 wings."
Gabriel is regarded with the exact same respect by Muslims as all of the Prophets, and upon saying his name or referring to him a Muslim repeats: "peace be upon him". Gabriel's primary tasks are to bring messages from God to His messengers. As in Christianity, Gabriel is said to be the angel that informed Mary (Arabic Maryam) of how she would conceive Jesus (Isa):
She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent to her Our Ruh [angel Jibrael (Gabriel)], and he appeared before her in the form of a man in all respects. She said: "Verily! I seek refuge with the Most Beneficent (God) from you, if you do fear God." (The angel) said: "I am only a Messenger from your Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son." She said: "How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, nor am I unchaste?" He said: "So (it will be), your Lord said: 'That is easy for Me (God): And (We wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind and a mercy from Us (God), and it is a matter (already) decreed, (by God).' "
(Quran, [Qur'an†19:17])
Muslims believe Gabriel to have accompanied Muhammad in his ascension to the heavens, where Muhammad also is said to have met previous messengers of God, and was informed about the Islamic prayer (Bukhari 1:8:345). Muslims also believe that Gabriel descends to Earth on the night of Laylat al-Qadr ("The Night of Great Value"), a night in the last ten days of the holy month of Ramadan in the Islamic calendar which is believed to be the night in which the Quran was first revealed.


The name Gabriel first appears in the Book of Daniel. The setting of the story is the Babylonian captivity: the Jewish leader Daniel ponders the meanings of several visions he has experienced in exile, when Gabriel appears to him with a message about the "End of Days":
