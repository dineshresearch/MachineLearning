Shuhari
Shuhari is a Japanese martial arts concept, and describes the stages of learning to mastery. It is sometimes applied to other disciplines, such as Go.
A rough translation of the three stages:
Shu Ha Ri can be considered as concentric circles, with Shu within Ha, and both Shu and Ha within Ri. The fundamental techniques and knowledge do not change.[1]
During the Shu phase the student should loyally follow the instruction of a single teacher; the student is not yet ready to explore and compare different paths.[2]

Chinese martial arts (or popularly known as Wushu) have similar 3 stage concept to Mastery. They are sometimes known as:
The Shuhari concept is first presented by Fuhaku Kawakami as Jo-ha-kyÅ« in Tao of Tea. Then, Zeami, the master of Noh, extended this concept to his dance as Shu-Ha-Ri, which is to be lent as a concept of Aikido.
