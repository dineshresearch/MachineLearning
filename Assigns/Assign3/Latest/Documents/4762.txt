Durian
There are currently 30 recognised species (see text)
The durian (pronounced /Ààd ä…ôri…ôn/)[1] is the fruit of several tree species belonging to the genus Durio and the Malvaceae family[2][3] (although some taxonomists place Durio in a distinct family, Durionaceae[3]). Widely-known and revered in southeast Asia as the "king of fruits", the durian is distinctive for its large size, unique odour, and formidable thorn-covered husk. The fruit can grow as large as 30†centimetres (12†in) long and 15†centimetres (6†in) in diameter, and it typically weighs one to three†kilograms (2 to 7†lb). Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale-yellow to red, depending on the species.
The edible flesh emits a distinctive odour, strong and penetrating even when the husk is intact. Some people regard the durian as fragrant; others find the aroma overpowering and offensive. The smell evokes reactions from deep appreciation to intense disgust. The odour has led to the fruit's banishment from certain hotels and public transportation in southeast Asia.
The durian, native to Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia, has been known to the Western world for about 600†years. The 19th-century British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace famously described its flesh as "a rich custard highly flavoured with almonds". The flesh can be consumed at various stages of ripeness, and is used to flavour a wide variety of savoury and sweet edibles in Southeast Asian cuisines. The seeds can also be eaten when cooked.
There are 30 recognised Durio species, at least nine of which produce edible fruit. Durio zibethinus is the only species available in the international market: other species are sold in their local regions. There are hundreds of durian cultivars; many consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.

Durian trees are relatively large, growing to 25‚Äì50†metres (80‚Äì165†ft) in height depending on the species.[4] The leaves are evergreen, elliptic to oblong and 10‚Äì18†centimetres (4‚Äì7†in) long. The flowers are produced in three to thirty clusters together on large branches and directly on the trunk with each flower having a calyx (sepals) and five (rarely four or six) petals. Durian trees have one or two flowering and fruiting periods per year, though the timing varies depending on the species, cultivars, and localities. A typical durian tree can bear fruit after four or five years. The durian fruit can hang from any branch and matures roughly three months after pollination. The fruit can grow up to 30†centimetres (12†in) long and 15†centimetres (6†in) in diameter, and typically weighs one to three kilograms (2 to 7†lb).[4] Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale-yellow to red, depending on the species.[4] Among the thirty known species of Durio, nine of them have been identified as producing edible fruits: D. zibethinus, D. dulcis, D. grandiflorus, D. graveolens, D. kutejensis, D. lowianus, D. macrantha, D. oxleyanus and D. testudinarum.[5] However, there are many species for which the fruit has never been collected or properly examined, so other species with edible fruit may exist.[4]
The name durian comes from the Malay word duri (thorn) together with the suffix -an (for building a noun in Malay).[6][7] D. zibethinus is the only species commercially cultivated on a large scale and available outside of its native region. Since this species is open-pollinated, it shows considerable diversity in fruit colour and odour, size of flesh and seed, and tree phenology. In the species name, zibethinus refers to the Indian civet, Viverra zibetha. There is disagreement regarding whether this name, bestowed by Linnaeus, refers to civets being so fond of the durian that the fruit was used as bait to entrap them, or to the durian smelling like the civet.[8]
Durian flowers are large and feathery with copious nectar, and give off a heavy, sour and buttery odour. These features are typical of flowers pollinated by certain species of bats that eat nectar and pollen.[9] According to research conducted in Malaysia in the 1970s, durians were pollinated almost exclusively by cave fruit bats (Eonycteris spelaea).[4] However, a 1996 study indicated two species, D. grandiflorus and D. oblongus, were pollinated by spiderhunters (Nectariniidae) and another species, D. kutejensis, was pollinated by giant honey bees and birds as well as bats.[10]

Over the centuries, numerous durian cultivars propagated by vegetative clones have arisen in southeast Asia. They used to be grown with mixed results from seeds of trees bearing superior quality fruit, but are now propagated by layering, marcotting, or more commonly, by grafting, including bud, veneer, wedge, whip or U-grafting onto seedlings of randomly selected rootstocks. Different cultivars can be distinguished to some extent by variations in the fruit shape, such as the shape of the spines.[4] Durian consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.[11]
Most cultivars have a common name and a code number starting with "D". For example, some popular clones are Kop (D99 Thai: ‡∏Å‡∏ö, k√≤p), Chanee (D123, Thai: ‡∏ä‡∏∞‡∏ô‡∏µ,  ® ∞√°niÀê), Berserah or Green Durian or Tuan Mek Hijau (D145 Thai: ‡∏ó‡∏∏‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ß, t ∞√∫riÀêan k ∞«êÀêaw), Kan Yao (D158, Thai: ‡∏Å‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏ß, k√¢Àên jaÀêw), Mon Thong (D159, Thai: ‡∏´‡∏°‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏á, m…îÃåÀên t ∞…îÀê≈ã), Kradum Thong (Thai: ‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏î‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏á, kr√†dum t ∞…îÀê≈ã), and with no common name, D24 and D169. Each cultivar has a distinct taste and odour. More than 200 cultivars of D. zibethinus exist in Thailand. Chanee is the most preferred rootstock due to its resistance to infection by Phytophthora palmivora. Among all the cultivars in Thailand, only four are currently in large-scale commercial cultivation: Chanee, Kradum Thong, Mon Thong, and Kan Yao.[4] There are more than 100 registered cultivars in Malaysia[12] and many superior cultivars have been identified through competitions held at the annual Malaysian Agriculture, Horticulture and Agrotourism Show. In Vietnam, the same process has been done through competitions held by the Southern Fruit Research Institute.
In recent times, Songpol Somsri, a Thai government scientist, crossbred more than ninety varieties of durian to create Chantaburi No.†1, a cultivar without the characteristic odour, which is awaiting final approval from the local Ministry of Agriculture.[13] Another hybrid, Chantaburi No. 3, develops the odour about three days after the fruit is picked, which enables an odourless transport yet satisfies consumers who prefer the pungent odour.[13]

The durian is native to Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. There is some debate as to whether the durian is native to the Philippines, or was introduced.[4] The durian is grown in other areas with a similar climate; it is strictly tropical and stops growing when mean daily temperatures drop below 22†¬∞C (72†¬∞F).[5]
The centre of ecological diversity for durians is the island of Borneo, where the fruit of the edible species of Durio including D. zibethinus, D. dulcis, D. graveolens, D. kutejensis, D. oxleyanus and D. testudinarum are sold in local markets. In Brunei, D. zibethinus is not grown because consumers prefer other species such as D. graveolens, D. kutejensis and D. oxleyanus. These species are commonly distributed in Brunei, and together with other species like D. testudinarum and D. dulcis, represent rich genetic diversity.[14]
Although the durian is not native to Thailand, the country is currently one of the major exporters of durians, growing 781,000†tonnes (769,000†LT; 861,000†ST) of the world's total harvest of 1,400,000†tonnes (1,380,000†LT; 1,540,000†ST) in 1999, of which it exported 111,000†tonnes (109,000†LT; 122,000†ST).[15] Malaysia and Indonesia follow, both producing about 265,000†tonnes (261,000†LT; 292,000†ST) each. Of this, Malaysia exported 35,000†tonnes (34,000†LT; 39,000†ST) in 1999.[15] Chantaburi in Thailand each year holds the World Durian Festival in early May. This single province is responsible for half of the durian production of Thailand.[16][17] In the Philippines, the centre of durian production is the Davao Region. The Kadayawan Festival is an annual celebration featuring the durian in Davao City. Other places where durians are grown include Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, India, Sri Lanka, the West Indies, Florida, Hawaii, Papua New Guinea, the Polynesian Islands, Madagascar, southern China (Hainan Island), northern Australia, and Singapore.
Durian was introduced into Australia in the early 1960s and clonal material was first introduced in 1975. Over thirty clones of D. zibethinus and six Durio species have been subsequently introduced into Australia.[18] China is the major importer, purchasing 65,000†tonnes (64,000†LT; 72,000†ST) in 1999, followed by Singapore with 40,000†tonnes (39,000†LT; 44,000†ST) and Taiwan with 5,000†tonnes (4,900†LT; 5,500†ST). In the same year, the United States imported 2,000†tonnes (2,000†LT; 2,200†ST), mostly frozen, and the European Community imported 500†tonnes (490†LT; 550†ST).[15]
The durian is a seasonal fruit, unlike some other non-seasonal tropical fruits such as the papaya which are available throughout the year. In Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, the season for durians is typically from June to August, which coincides with that of the mangosteen.[4] Prices of durians are relatively high as compared with other fruits. For example, in Singapore, the strong demand for high quality cultivars such as the D24, Sultan, and Mao Shan Wang has resulted in typical retail prices of between S$8 to S$15 (US$5 to US$10) per kilogram of whole fruit.[11] With an average weight of about 1.5†kilograms (3.3†lb), a durian fruit would therefore cost about S$12 to S$22 (US$8 to US$15).[11] The edible portion of the fruit, known as the aril and usually referred to as the "flesh" or "pulp", only accounts for about 15-30% of the mass of the entire fruit.[4] Many consumers in Singapore are nevertheless quite willing to spend up to around S$75 (US$50) in a single purchase of about half a dozen of the favoured fruit to be shared by family members.[11]
In season durians can be found in mainstream Japanese supermarkets while, in the West, they are sold mainly by Asian markets.

The unusual flavour and odour of the fruit have prompted many people to express diverse and passionate views ranging from deep appreciation to intense disgust. Writing in 1856, the British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace provides a much-quoted description of the flavour of the durian:
While Wallace cautions that "the smell of the ripe fruit is certainly at first disagreeable", later descriptions by westerners are more graphic. British novelist Anthony Burgess writes that eating durian is "like eating sweet raspberry blancmange in the lavatory."[20] Chef Andrew Zimmern compares the taste to "completely rotten, mushy onions."[21] Anthony Bourdain, while a lover of durian, relates his encounter with the fruit as thus: "Its taste can only be described as...indescribable, something you will either love or despise. ...Your breath will smell as if you'd been French-kissing your dead grandmother."[22] Travel and food writer Richard Sterling says:
Other comparisons have been made with the civet, sewage, stale vomit, skunk spray and used surgical swabs.[24] The wide range of descriptions for the odour of durian may have a great deal to do with the variability of durian odour itself. Durians from different species or clones can have significantly different aromas; for example, red durian (D. dulcis) has a deep caramel flavour with a turpentine odour while red-fleshed durian (D. graveolens) emits a fragrance of roasted almonds.[25] Among the varieties of D. zibethinus, Thai varieties are sweeter in flavour and less odourous than Malay ones.[4] The degree of ripeness has an effect on the flavour as well.[4] Three scientific analyses of the composition of durian aroma ‚Äî from 1972, 1980, and 1995 ‚Äî each found a mix of volatile compounds including esters, ketones, and different sulphur compounds, with no agreement on which may be primarily responsible for the distinctive odour.[4]
This strong odour can be detected half a mile away by animals, thus luring them. In addition, the fruit is extremely appetising to a variety of animals, including squirrels, mouse deer, pigs, orangutan, elephants, and even carnivorous tigers. While some of these animals eat the fruit and dispose of the seed under the parent plant, others swallow the seed with the fruit and then transport it some distance before excreting, with the seed being dispersed as a result.[26] The thorny, armoured covering of the fruit discourages smaller animals; larger animals are more likely to transport the seeds far from the parent tree.[27]

According to Larousse Gastronomique, the durian fruit is ready to eat when its husk begins to crack.[28] However, the ideal stage of ripeness to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of D. zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the
