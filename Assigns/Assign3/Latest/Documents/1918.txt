Mike Gravel
Libertarian (2008-present)
Maurice Robert "Mike" Gravel (pronounced /grəˈvɛl/) (born May 13, 1930) is a former Democratic United States Senator from Alaska, who served two terms from 1969 to 1981, and a former candidate in the 2008 presidential election.
Born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts to French-Canadian immigrant parents, Gravel served in the United States Army in West Germany and graduated from Columbia University. He moved to Alaska in the late 1950s, becoming a real estate developer and entering politics. He served in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1963 to 1966 and became its Speaker of the House. Gravel was elected to the United States Senate in 1968.
As Senator, Gravel became nationally known for his forceful but unsuccessful attempts to end the draft during the Vietnam War and for having put the Pentagon Papers into the public record in 1971 despite risk to himself. He conducted an unusual campaign for the Democratic nomination for Vice President of the United States in 1972, and then played a crucial role in getting Congressional approval for the Trans-Alaska pipeline in 1973. He was re-elected to the Senate in 1974, but gradually alienated most of his Alaskan constituencies and his bid for a third term was defeated in a Democratic primary election in 1980.
Gravel returned to business ventures and went through difficult times, suffering corporate and personal bankruptcies amid poor health. He became a passionate advocate of direct democracy and the National Initiative. In 2006, Gravel began a run for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in part to promote those ideas. His campaign gained an Internet following and national attention due to forceful and idiosyncratic debate appearances during 2007, but showed very little support in national polls or in 2008 caucuses and primaries. In March 2008, he announced he was switching to the Libertarian Party and competing for its presidential nomination. In May 2008, he finished fourth at the Libertarian National Convention and announced his political career had ended.

Gravel was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, to French-Canadian immigrant parents Marie Bourassa and Alphonse Gravel, a painting contractor.[2] His parents were part of the Quebec diaspora,[3] and he was raised in a working class neighborhood[4] speaking only French until he was seven years old.[5] Initially a poor student (due to what he later said was undiagnosed dyslexia[6][5]), he was educated in parochial schools as a Roman Catholic, attending Assumption College Preparatory School. He has a sister, Marguerite, who became a nun,[2] but Gravel himself struggled with Catholicism.[1]
Gravel studied for one year at American International College in Springfield,[7] then enlisted in the United States Army in 1951 and served in West Germany as a Special Adjutant in the Communication and Intelligent Services and as a Special Agent in the Counter Intelligence Corps until 1954,[8][4] eventually becoming a First Lieutenant.[9] He attended Columbia University's School of General Studies in New York City, where he studied economics and received a B.S. in 1956.[10] He had come to New York "flat broke",[9] and supported himself by working as a bar boy in a hotel,[9] driving a taxicab,[11] and working in the investment bond department at Bankers Trust.[9] During this time he left the Catholic faith.[1]

Gravel "decided to become a pioneer in a faraway place,"[9] and moved to pre-statehood Alaska in 1956, without funds or a job, looking for a place where someone without social or political connections could be a viable candidate for public office;[11][5] Alaska's voting age of 19, less than most other states' 21, played a role,[12] as did its newness[5] and cooler climate.[11] He found work in several areas, including real estate sales, brakeman for the Alaska Railroad, and as a very successful property developer on the Kenai Peninsula.[13][9] He joined the Anchorage Unitarian Universalist fellowship, and would continue a sporadic relationship with the movement throughout his life.[1]
Gravel married Rita Jeannette Martin, who had been Anchorage's "Miss Fur Rendezvous" of 1958,[14] on April 29, 1959.[14] They had two children, Martin Anthony Gravel and Lynne Denise Gravel,[14] born circa 1960 and 1962 respectively.[12] Meanwhile, he went to Washington, D.C. in 1957 to campaign for Alaskan statehood via the "Tennessee Plan": dressed as Paul Revere, he rode with a petition to the steps of the U.S. Capitol.[15] He ran unsuccessfully for the territorial legislature in 1958.[11] He went on a national speaking tour concerning tax reform in 1959, sponsored by the Jaycees.[10] He ran unsuccessfully for the Anchorage City Council in 1960.[11]

With some newfound wealthy backers,[12] Gravel ran for the Alaska House of Representatives representing Anchorage in 1962 and won.[11]
Gravel served in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1963 to 1966, winning re-election in 1964. During 1965 and 1966, he served as the Speaker of the House, surprising observers by winning that post.[12] As Speaker he antagonized fellow lawmakers by imposing his will on the legislature's committees.[12]
He did not run for re-election in 1966, instead choosing to run for Alaska's seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, losing to four-term incumbent Democrat Ralph Rivers[11] by 1,300 votes[12] and splitting the Democratic party in the process.[12]
Following his defeat, Gravel returned to the real estate business in Anchorage.[12]


In 1968 he ran against the 81-year-old incumbent Democratic Senator Ernest Gruening, a popular former governor of the Alaska Territory who was considered one of the fathers of Alaska's statehood,[11] for his party's nomination to the U.S. Senate. Gravel's campaign was primarily based on his youth.[12] He hired Joseph Napolitan, the first self-described political consultant, in late 1966.[12] They spent over a year and a half planning a short primary election campaign that featured the slogan "Let's do something about the state we're in"[16] as well as a half-hour, well-produced[11] biographical film of Gravel that was shown frequently on both television and on home projectors in many Eskimo villages.[12] The heavy showings quickly reversed a large Gruening lead in polls into a Gravel lead.[12] Gravel also benefited by being deliberately ambiguous about his Vietnam policy. Gruening had been one of only two Senators to vote against the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and, according to Gravel, "...all I had to do was stand up and not deal with the subject, and people would assume that I was to the right of Ernest Gruening, when in point of fact I was to the left of him."[11]
Gravel unexpectedly beat Gruening in a tight result[17] in the primary and went on to win the general election, gaining 45 percent of the vote against 37 percent for Republican Elmer E. Rasmuson and 18 percent for Gruening, who ran a write-in campaign as an Independent.[18]

Gravel served on the Environment and Public Works Committee throughout his Senate career. He also served on the Finance and Interior Committees and he chaired the Energy, Water Resources, and Environmental Pollution subcommittees.[19]
By his own admission, Gravel was too new and "too abrasive" to be effective in the Senate by the usual means of seniority-based committee assignments or negotiating deals with other senators,[12][20] and was sometimes seen as arrogant by the more senior members.[12] Gravel instead relied upon attention-getting gestures to achieve what he wanted, hoping national exposure would force other senators to listen to him.[20] As part of this he voted with Southern Democrats to keep the Senate filibuster rule in place,[12] and accordingly supported Russell Long and Robert Byrd and opposed Ted Kennedy in Senate leadership battles.[12] In retrospective assessment, University of Alaska Anchorage history professor Stephen Haycox would say, "Loose cannon is a good description of Gravel's Senate career. He was an off-the-wall guy, and you weren't really ever sure what he would do."[21]

In the late 1960s and early 1970s the U.S. Department of Defense was in the process of performing tests for the nuclear warhead for the Spartan anti-ballistic missile interceptor. Two tests, the Milrow and Cannikin tests, were planned, involving the detonation of nuclear bombs under Amchitka Island in Alaska. The Milrow test would be a one megaton calibration exercise for the second, and larger five megaton, Cannikin test, which would measure the effectiveness of the warhead. Gravel opposed the tests in Congress. Before the October 1969 Milrow test took place, he wrote that there were significant risks of earthquakes and other adverse consequences, and called for an independent national commission on nuclear and seismic safety to be created;[22] he then made a personal appeal to President Nixon to stop the test.[23]
After Milrow was conducted, there was continued pressure on the part of environmental groups against going forward with the larger Cannikin test, while the Federation of American Scientists claimed the warhead being tested was already obsolete.[23] In May 1971 Gravel sent a letter to Atomic Energy Commission hearings held in Anchorage, in which he said the risk of the test was not worth taking.[24] Eventually a group not involving Gravel took the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to issue an injunction against it,[25] and the Cannikin test took place as scheduled in November 1971.[25] Gravel had failed to stop the tests (notwithstanding his later claims during his 2008 presidential campaign[26]).
Nuclear power was considered an environmentally clean alternative for the commercial generation of electricity and was part of a popular national policy for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the 1950s and 1960s.[27] Gravel publicly opposed this policy; besides the dangers of nuclear testing, he was a vocal critic of the Atomic Energy Commission,[27] which oversaw American nuclear efforts, and of the powerful United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, which had a stranglehold on nuclear policy and which Gravel tried to circumvent.[27] In 1971, Gravel sponsored a bill to impose a moratorium on nuclear power plant construction and to make power utilities liable for any nuclear accidents;[28] in 1975, he was still proposing similar moratoriums.[29] By 1974, Gravel was allied with Ralph Nader's organization in opposing nuclear power.[30]
Six months before United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's secret mission to the People's Republic of China in July 1971, Gravel introduced legislation to recognize and normalize relations with China, including a proposal for unity talks between China and Republic of China (Taiwan) regarding the China seat at the United Nations.[31] Gravel reiterated his position in favor of recognition, with four other senators in agreement, during Senate hearings in June 1971.[32]

President Richard Nixon had campaigned in 1968 on a promise to end the U.S. military draft,[33][34] a decision endorsed by the February 1970 report of the Gates Commission.[33][
