Systemantics
Systemantics (retitled The Systems Bible in its third edition) is a text by John Gall in which he proposes several "laws" of systems' failures. Systemantics is a play on words on semantics and systems display antics.
It is written in the style of a serious academic work, and is often mistakenly cited as such. The content is similar in style to Murphy's Law and the Peter Principle, which are both referenced in the work.
Of course, from outside the System of Defining Serious Academic Work, this volume (and others like it) may be seen as utterly serious, merely wearing a fake nose and bushy eyebrows to distract the pedantic system-encysted. One can make a case that it fulfills the spirit of Serious Academic Work: illuminating Reality. As always, the reader should make up his or her own mind.
The final paragraph of Systemantics is as follows:
"There are some who assert that General SystemANTICS is a spoof of a serious scientific subject called General System Theory. Devotees of General System Theory attribute the founding of their science to Professor Ludwig von Bertalanffy, who noted, in the early decades of this century, that scientists had overlooked the establishment of a science of Anything and Everything and who, with Teutonic thoroughness, made up the oversight." (p. 141)



Systemantics can be reduced to two propositions roughly equivalent to the use of abstinence and condoms:
