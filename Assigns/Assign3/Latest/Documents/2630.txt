Squarepusher
Squarepusher is the performing pseudonym of Tom Jenkinson, an English electronic music artist signed to Warp Records. He specialises in the electronic music genres of drum and bass and acid, with a significant jazz and musique concr√®te influence.
Jenkinson was born in Chelmsford, Essex in 1975 and was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School. He went on to study Mathematics at Imperial College, London. Jenkinson performs live, playing with a fretless or fretted bass guitar, a laptop, and other hardware. He appeared twice on BBC Radio 1's The Breezeblock show.

Squarepusher sequenced his pre-2000 work on a BOSS DR-660 drum machine. He uses hardware for his electronic music such as King Tubby-style spring reverbs, Akai samplers, (S950 for early work, S6000 for later work), a Roland SH-101 synthesizer, a Roland TB-303 bassline synthesizer, and a reel-to-reel tape machine. Around the year 2000, Squarepusher bought a computer with Reaktor and an Eventide Orville for digital processing. According to a list of gear from the official website, Squarepusher owns.
He has been known to play Fender, Ernie Ball, and Warwick basses.
Perhaps the most ubiquitous sample associated with many Squarepusher songs is the use of the Amen break.
He is currently performing live with drummer Alex Thomas.
