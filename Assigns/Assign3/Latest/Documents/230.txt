Peoples Temple
Peoples Temple was an organization founded in 1955 by Jim Jones that, by the mid-1970s, possessed over a dozen locations in California including its headquarters in San Francisco. It is best known for causing the death of 918 people on November 18, 1978 in Guyana, at the Peoples Temple Agricultural Project (informally called "Jonestown"), a nearby airstrip at Port Kaituma, and Georgetown.
The tragedy at Jonestown resulted in the greatest single loss of American civilian life in a non-natural disaster until the incidents of September 11, 2001. At the airstrip, Temple members murdered, among others, Congressman Leo Ryan, the only Congressman murdered in the line of duty in United States history.


Before forming a church, Jim Jones had become enamored of communism and frustrated by the harassment communists received in the U.S.[1] This, among other things, provoked a seminal moment for Jones, as he himself described on a biography tape, where he stated:[1][2]

Although he faced backlash for being a communist, Jones was surprised that a Methodist superintendent whom he had not met through the American Communist Party helped Jones into the church despite his knowledge that Jones was a communist.[3] In 1952, Jones became a student pastor in Sommerset Southside Methodist Church in Indianapolis, but left that church because it barred him from integrating African Americans into his congregation.[2] In 1954, Jones began his own church in rented space in Indianapolis, at first naming it the Community Unity Church.[2]
Jones had previously witnessed a faith-healing service at the Seventh Day Baptist Church, observed that it attracted people and their cash and concluded that with financial resources from such healings, he could help accomplish his social goals.[2] Jones and Temple members knowingly faked healings because they found that the increased faith derived therefrom generated financial resources to help the poor and finance the church.[2] These faked healings involved using chicken livers and other animal tissue that existing Temple members and Jones claimed were cancerous tissues removed from the body.[4]
In 1956, Jones bought his first church building in a racially mixed Indianapolis neighborhood and named the church Wings of Deliverance,[5] and later that year the "Peoples Temple Full Gospel Church", the first title incorporating the name "Peoples Temple."[2] Jones' healings and purported clairvoyant revelations attracted spiritualists.[5]

In order to increase publicity, the Temple organized large religious "conventions" with other Pentecostal pastors, though Jones continued to disguise his atheism and the fact that he was using religion to further social goals.[5] Those conventions drew as many as 11,000 attendees.[5] Jones and the other preachers conducted "healings" and impressed attendees by knowing private information â€“ usually numbers, such as addresses, phone numbers or social security numbers â€“ that private detectives could easily discover beforehand.[5]
Jones and Temple members drove through various cities in Indiana and Ohio on recruiting and fund raising efforts.[6]
While the Temple had increased African-American membership from 15% to nearly 50%, in order to attempt further gains, the Temple hired African-American preacher Archie Ijames, who had earlier given up organized religion.[5] The Temple stressed egalitarian ideals, asking members to attend in casual clothes so poor members would not feel out of place and providing shelter for needy citizens.[7] Pastor Ijames was one of the first to commit to Jones' socialist collective program.[7] In 1959, the church joined the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and was renamed the Peoples Temple Christian Church Full Gospel.[2] This affiliation was a successful attempt to both raise the dwindling membership and restore the reputation of the organization.
In February 1960, the Temple opened a soup kitchen for the poor and expanded social services, including rent assistance, job placement services and giving poor citizens canned goods, clothing and coal for winter heating.[7] After Ijames and his wife had "gone communal", the couple helped to increase the Temple's soup kitchen to an average of about 2,800 meals per month.[7]
The Temple's public profile was elevated when Jones was appointed to the Indianapolis Human Rights Commission, engaged in public attempts to integrate businesses and was the subject of much local media coverage. [8]

Jones had read extensively about Father Divine, the founder of the International Peace Mission movement.[9] Jones and Temple members visited Divine several times, while Jones studied his writings and tape recordings of his sermons.[10] The Temple printed Divine's texts for its members and began to preach that members should abstain from sex and only adopt children.[10]
In 1959, in a sermon in his Delaware Street Temple, Jones tested the new fiery rhetorical style that Divine had used.[11] His speech captivated members with lulls and crescendos, as Jones challenged individual members in front of the group.[11] The speech also marked the beginning of the Temple's underlying "us versus them" message.[11] Jones carefully weaved in that the Temple's home for senior citizens was established on the basis "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need," quoting Karl Marx's "Critique of the Gotha Program."[12] He did so playing upon the fact that his Christian audience would notice the similarities with text from Acts of the Apostles 4:34-35 which stated "distribution was made to each as any had need."[12] Jones would repeatedly cite that passage to call Jesus Christ a communist, while at the same time attacking the text of the Bible.[12]
The Temple began tightening its organization.[7] It asked more of its members than did other churches.[7] It also required that members spend Thanksgiving and Christmas with its Temple "family" rather than with blood relatives.[7] This began the Temple's procedures to wean members from families and redirect their lives toward a total commitment to the Temple's social and political goals.[7] Jones began to offer a deal towards a socialist collective, Jones then referred to as "religious communalism", in which members would donate their material possessions to the Temple in exchange for the Temple meeting those members' needs.[7] Pastor Ijames was one of the first to commit.[7]
However hard it tried, the Temple had little luck converting fundamentalist Christian midwestern capitalists to communist ideals, even if disguised.[13] After Jones admired Fidel Castro's overthrow of Batista in Cuba in 1959, Jones traveled to Cuba in 1960 to attempt to convert poor Cuban blacks to move to his congregation in Indiana.[13] The plan failed.[13]
The Temple's religious message changed in this period to one treading between atheism and the subtle notion that Jones was a Christ-like figure.[14] While Temple aides complained privately, Jones said that that message was needed to foster members' dedication to the Temple's larger goals.[14] Jones maintained such implications until the mid-to-late 1970s, when he dropped them.[14]
In 1961, Jones claimed he had a vision of Chicago coming under a nuclear attack.[15] He claimed that Indianapolis would also be destroyed.[15] This convinced aides that the Temple needed to look for a new location. A 1962 Esquire magazine article listed the nine safest places to be in a nuclear war, with Belo Horizonte, Brazil topping the list because of its location and atmospheric conditions.[16]
Jones traveled through Brazil from 1962 through early 1963.[17] He requested money from the Temple while in Rio de Janeiro, but the Temple lacked adequate funds for such a request because of shrinking finances in Jones' absence.[17] Jones sent a preacher that had become a follower of Jones in Brazil back to Indiana to help preachers there stabilize the Temple. [18]


After traveling in Brazil, Jones returned to Indiana in 1963.[2] While Jones had always spoken of the social gospel's virtues, before the late 1960s, Jones did not reveal that his gospel was actually communism.[2] By the late 1960s, Jones began openly revealing in Temple sermons his "Apostolic Socialism" concept.[2][19] The concept often loosely mixed tenets of atheism and socialism.[note 1] During this period, Jones preached to new members that the Holy Spirit was within them, but that Jones' healing power demonstrated that he was a special manifestation of "Christ the Revolution."[2] He also preached that the United States was the Antichrist and capitalism was "the Antichrist system."[2]
Jones preached of an imminent nuclear holocaust, and that the surviving elect would then create a new socialist Eden on earth.[2] In 1965, he predicted this would occur on July 15, 1967.[2] Accordingly, Jones preached that the Temple must move to Redwood Valley, California.[2] Jones led approximately 140 members, half of whom were black, to Redwood Valley in July of 1965 and officially opened church in Ukiah.[6][20] The addition of deputy district attorney Timothy Stoen greatly increased the Temple's credibility in the area, quickly increasing membership.[20]
Jones began deriding traditional Christianity as "fly away religion," and rejected the Bible as being white menâ€™s' justification to dominate women and enslave people of color.[2] Jones authored a booklet he would distribute in the Temple titled "The Letter Killeth,"[21] pointing out what he felt were the contradictions, absurdities, and atrocities in the Bible, but also stating that the Bible contained great truths. Jones preached that the "Divine Principle" equated with "Love," and Love was equated with "Socialism."[2] He stated that the Bible only contained beliefs about a "Sky God" or "Buzzard God," who was no God at all.[2]

Because of limited expansion in the Ukiah area, eventually moving the seat of power to an urban area appeared to be a strategic necessity.[22] In 1970, the Temple began holding services in San Francisco and Los Angeles.[23] It established permanent facilities in those cities in 1971 and 1972, respectively.[22]
By 1972 the Temple was calling Redwood Valley the "mother church" of a "statewide political movement." [22] From the start, the Los Angeles facility's primary purpose was recruitment and to serve as a way station for the Temple's weekly bus trips across California.[22] The Temple set up a permanent staff in Los Angeles and arranged bus trips to Los Angeles every other week.[22] The substantial attendance and collections in Los Angeles helped to support the Temple's inflated membership claims.[22] The Los Angeles facility was physically larger than that in San Francisco.[22] Its central location at the corner of Alvarado and Hoover streets permitted easy geographic access for a large African-American membership from Watts and Compton.[22]
Recruiting drives in Los Angeles and San Francisco cities helped to increase membership in the Peoples Temple from a few hundred to nearly 3,000 by the mid-70s.[24] Later, when the Temple's headquarters shifted from Redwood Valley to San Francisco, the Temple convinced many Los Angeles members to move north to its new headquarters.[22]

Although some descriptions of Peoples Temple emphasize Jonesâ€™ autocratic control over Temple operation, in actuality the Temple possessed a complex leadership structure with decision-making power unevenly dispersed among its members. However, within that structure, Temple members were subjected unwittingly and gradually to sophisticated mind control and behavior-modification techniques borrowed from post-revolutionary China and North Korea.[25] The Temple brightly defined psychological borders over which "enemies", such as "traitors" to the Temple, crossed at their own peril.[25] While the secrecy and caution he demanded in recruiting led to decreased overall membership, they also helped Jones to better foster a hero worship of himself as the "ultimate socialist."[25]
In the early 1970s, the Temple established a more formal hierarchy for its socialistic model. [26] At the top were the Temple's "Staff", a select group of eight to ten unquestionably obedient college-educated women that undertook the most sensitive missions for the Temple.[26] They necessarily acclimated themselves to an "ends justify the means" philosophy.[26] The earliest member was Sandy Bradshaw, a 24 year old socialist from Syracuse, New York who had rejected God at age seven.[26] Others included Carolyn Layton, a 31 year old Communist since the age of 15 who was the mother of a child with Jones; Sharon Amos, who worked for the social services department; Patty Cartmell, Jones' secretary; and Terry Buford, a Navy brat turned pacifist.[26] The group was often scorned as being elitist the egalitarian Temple organization, and were viewed as Temple secret police.[26]
The Temple's "Planning Commission" was its governing board.[27][28] Membership quickly ballooned from 50 to over 100.[27][29] Members convened for meetings during the week in various Redwood Valley locations that sometimes ran until dawn.[27] The Planning Commission was responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Temple, including key decision-making, financial and legal planning, and oversight of the organization.[30] The Planning Commission sat over various other committees, such as the "Diversions Committee", which carried out tasks such as
