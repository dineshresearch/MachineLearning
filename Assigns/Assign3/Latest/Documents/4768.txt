Aza Raskin
Aza Raskin (born 1984) is an American design expert[1] and interface guru[2]. He is the son of noted human-computer interface expert Jef Raskin.

Raskin gave his first talk on user interfaces at age 10 at the local San Francisco chapter of SIGCHI.[3] By 20, he was speaking internationally.[4] He holds bachelor degrees in math and physics from the University of Chicago.[5] He attended Caltech briefly as a Ph.D. student in Physics, continuing the dark matter research he had participated in at both the University of Chicago and University of Tokyo.[citation needed] The University of Chicago was the only school Raskin ever completed, having left middle school, high school, and graduate school.[citation needed]
In 2004, Aza Raskin worked with Jef Raskin at the Raskin Center for Humane Interfaces on Archy, a new user interface paradigm.[6] The next year, he founded Humanized Inc. to continue work on the Archy paradigm. At Humanized, he created the language-based service-oriented Enso software.
In 2008, Raskin and the other Humanized employees were part of a hire-out by the Mozilla Corporation.[7] Raskin is currently the head of user experience at Mozilla Labs[5] and has been instrumental in many projects including Firefox Mobile[8] and Ubiquity.[9]
Raskin is successful entrepreneur having founded two other companies, including Songza, a music meta-search tool; Bloxes, which sells furniture made out of cardboard[10]. Songza was acquired in late 2008 by Amazon-backed Amie Street, for reportedly in the low seven figures[11]. He also has a number of smaller projects like Algorithm Ink, which generates art from a formal grammar.[12]
