Gocco
Gocco (プリントゴッコ ,Purinto Gokko?, "Print Gocco") is a self-contained compact color printing system invented in 1977 by Noboru Hayama. Gocco became immensely popular in Japan and it is estimated that one-third of Japanese households own a Print Gocco system.[1]
Using flash bulbs similar to those found in old cameras, an original image is thermally imprinted on a master screen.
The name "print gocco" is derived from the Japanese word gokko (ごっこ ?), loosely translated as make-believe play. Riso Kagaku president Noboru Hayama explained, "We [as kids] learned rules and knowledge through make-believe play. The spirit of play is an important cultural asset. I thought that I wanted to leave "play" in the product's name."
In December 2005, Gocco’s parent company, Riso Kagaku Corporation, announced it would end production of the Gocco system due to low sales in Japan. An Internet campaign was started to find a new home for the product.
As of June 2007, Riso Kagaku Corporation had resumed production of several lines of Print Gocco units and they were available in Japan and through limited import retail stores in the United States.[2] [3]
On May 30, 2008, the Riso Kagaku Corporation announced that it will stop shipping Gocco printers in June 2008. They blamed the sharp decline in demand for their printers on the increase in use of home computers and printers. They will continue producing supplies for the printers until further notice.

The "Print Gocco Lamp" flash bulbs are sold with a sticker reading:
"PROPOSITION 65 WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Use only as directed. Wash hands after use."
The chemical referred to is not explicitly called out and no additional information is provided on the unit. However, Proposition 65 warnings usually denote the presence of lead in a product.
