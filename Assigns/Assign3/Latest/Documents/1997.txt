Delicious Library
Delicious Library is a media cataloguing application for Mac OS X, developed by Delicious Monster. The software allows users to manage their collections of books, movies, CDs and video games by entering them manually or by using a Bluetooth scanner, an iSight camera, or a USB-keyboard-type barcode scanner (such as a modified CueCat).
Released in November 2004, Delicious Library sold $250,000 in its first month.[1]
