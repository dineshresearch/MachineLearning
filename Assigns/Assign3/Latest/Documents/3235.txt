Cloud Gate
Cloud Gate is a public sculpture by British artist Anish Kapoor. It is the centerpiece of the AT&T Plaza in Millennium Park within the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois, and is located on top of Park Grill and adjacent to the Chase Promenade. The sculpture was constructed between 2004 and 2006 and was temporarily unveiled in the summer of 2004. Nicknamed "The Bean" because of its legume-like shape, its exterior consists of 168 highly polished stainless steel plates. It is 33 feet by 66 feet by 42 feet (10 m Ã— 20 m Ã— 13 m), and weighs 110 short tons (99.8 t; 98.2 long tons). The sculpture and the plaza are sometimes referred to jointly as "Cloud Gate on the AT&T Plaza" or "Cloud Gate on AT&T Plaza".
Cloud Gate has become a very popular sculpture that is known worldwide. Inspired by liquid mercury, the sculpture's exterior reflects and transforms the city's skyline. Visitors are able to walk around and under Cloud Gate's arch, which is 12 feet (3.7 m) high. On the underside of the sculpture is the omphalos, a concave chamber that warps and multiplies reflections. The sculpture builds upon many of Kapoor's artistic themes, although many tourists simply view the sculpture and its unique reflective properties as a photo-taking opportunity.
The sculpture was the result of a design competition. After being chosen, numerous technological concerns regarding the design's construction and assembly arose, in addition to concerns regarding the sculpture's upkeep and maintenance. Various experts were consulted, some of whom believed the design could not be implemented. Eventually, a feasible method was found, but the sculpture fell behind schedule. It was unveiled in an incomplete form during the Millennium Park grand opening celebration before being concealed for completion.

In 1999, Millennium Park officials and a group of art collectors, curators and architects reviewed sculpture proposals from 30 different artists. Jeff Koons submitted a proposal to erect a permanent 150-foot (46 m) playground slide at the park.[1][2] Koons' glass and steel design featured a 90-foot (27 m) observation deck that was accessible via an elevator.[3] The committee chose the design of internationally-acclaimed artist Anish Kapoor. Measuring 33 feet by 66 feet by 42 feet (10 m Ã— 20 m Ã— 13 m) and weighing 110 short tons (99.8 t; 98.2 long tons), Kapoor's propoal featured a seamless, stainless steel surface that was inspired by liquid mercury. This mirror-like surface literally reflects the Chicago skyline, however, its elliptical shape distorts and twists this reflected image.[4] As visitors walk around the structure, its surface acts like a "fun-house mirror" as it distorts their reflections.[5] On the underside of the sculpture is the omphalos, an indentation whose mirrored surface provides multiple reflections of any subject situated beneath it.[6] It is 27 feet (8.2 m) high and, as a part of the concave underside, it allows visitors to walk under and through its arch to the other side so that they view the entire structure.[7] During the grand opening week, several press reports described the omphalos as the "spoon-like underbelly".[8][9] Kapoor's contract states that the constructed piece should be expected to survive for 1,000 years.[10] The stainless steel sculpture was originally envisioned at the southeast corner of the Lurie Garden, but park officials eventually decided to locate it at AT&T Plaza. Now, skyscrapers to the north along East Randolph Street (The Heritage, Smurfit-Stone Building, Two Prudential Plaza, One Prudential Plaza, and Aon Center) are visible on both the east and west sides of the sculpture.
The structure's complex form created numerous issues. Being outside, concerns arose that it might retain and convey hot and cold temperatures in a way that would make it too hot to touch during the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to it during the winter. It was also believed that the extreme temperature variation between seasons might weaken the structure. Graffiti, bird droppings and fingerprints were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the sculpture.[2][11] The most prominent issue was the need to create a single seamless exterior for the external shell, a feat architect Norman Foster once believed to be nearly impossible.[11]
While the sculpture was being constructed, public and media outlets nicknamed it "The Bean" because of its legume-like shape. Months later, Kapoor officially named the piece "Cloud Gate".[12] The name refers to the three-quarters of the sculpture's external surface that reflects the sky and acts as a type of gate that helps bridge the space between the sky and the viewer.[13] The sculpture and plaza are sometimes referred to jointly as "Cloud Gate on the AT&T Plaza".[14][15] It is Kapoor's first public outdoor work in the United States,[14] and is the work by which he may be best known in the country.[16]

The British engineering firm Aerotrope provided the sculpture's structural design,[17] and Performance Structures, Inc. (PSI) was chosen to fabricate it because of their ability to produce nearly invisible welds.[1] The project began with PSI attempting to recreate Kapoor's design in miniature. A high-density polyurethane foam model was selected by Kapoor, which was then used to design the final structure, including the interior structural components.[18] Initially, PSI planned to build and assemble the sculpture in Oakland, California, and ship it to Chicago through the Panama Canal and St. Lawrence Seaway. However, this plan was scrapped after park officials deemed it too risky.[1] Instead, the piece was assembled on-site by MTH Industries.[18]
The sculpture's weight raised concerns. Before fabrication, estimating the thickness of the steel needed to create the sculpture's desired aesthetics was difficult.[19] Originally, Cloud Gate was estimated to weigh 60 short tons (54.4 t; 53.6 long tons).[20] The final design, however, weighed 110 short tons (99.8 t; 98.2 long tons), almost double the first estimated figure. This extra weight required engineers to reconsider the sculpture's supporting structures. The roof of the Park Grill, upon which Cloud Gate sits, had to be built strong enough to bear the weight. The large retaining wall separating Chicago's Metra train tracks from the North Grant Park garage that travels along the back side of the restaurant supports much of the sculpture. This wall, along with the rest of the garage's foundation, required additional bracing before the piece was erected.[19] Cloud Gate is further buttressed by lateral members underneath the plaza that are anchored to the sculpture's interior structure by tie rods.[18]
Inside Cloud Gate's polished exterior shell are several steel structures that keep the sculpture standing. The first structural pieces, two type 304 stainless steel rings, were put into place in February 2004. As construction continued, crisscrossing pipe trusses were assembled between the two rings.[21] These supporting structural components were designed and constructed to ensure that no specific point was overloaded and to avoid producing unwanted indentations on the exterior shell. The frame was also designed to expand and contract with the sculpture as temperatures fluctuate. As a result, the two large rings supporting the sculpture move independently of one another, allowing the shell to move independently of the rings.[18]
When Cloud Gate's interior components were completed, construction crews prepared to begin working on the structure's outer shell. The shell comprises 168 stainless steel panels, each 3/8 inches (1.0 cm) thick and weighing 1,000 to 2,000 pounds (450 to 910 kg).[22] They were fabricated using three-dimensional modeling software. Metal stiffeners were welded to each panel's interior face to provide a small degree of rigidity. About a third of the plates, along with the entire interior structure, were fabricated in Oakland.[18] The plates were covered with protective white film and polished 98% before being sent to Chicago via trucks.[23] Once in Chicago, the plates were welded together on-site, creating 2,442 linear feet (744 m) of welded seams.[22] They were fabricated so precisely that no on-site cutting or filing was necessary when lifting and fitting the plates into position.[22]
In June 2004, when construction of the shell began, a large tent was erected around the piece to shield it from public view.[24] Construction began with the omphalos, where plates were attached to the supporting internal steel structure. These plates were attached from the inside (underside) of the sculpture downward to the outermost surfaces.[23] The sequence of construction caused the structure to look like a large sombrero when the bottom was complete.[25]
The sculpture was fully erected for the grand opening of Millennium Park on July 15, 2004, although it was unpolished and unfinished because its assembly had fallen behind schedule. The piece was temporarily uncovered on July 8 for the opening, though Kapoor was unhappy with this decision since it allowed the public to see the sculpture in an unfinished state.[26] Originally planned to be re-tented for polishing on July 24, public appreciation for the piece convinced park officials to leave it uncovered for several months. The tent was again erected in January 2005 while a 24-person crew from Ironworkers Local 63 polished the seams between each plate.[22][27] In order to grind, sand and polish the seams, six levels of scaffolding were erected around the sides of the sculpture, while climbing ropes and harnesses were used to polish harder-to-reach areas.[22] When the upper and side portions of the shell were completed, the tent was once again removed in August 2005. On October 3, the omphalos was closed off as workers polished the final section.[28] Every weld on the Cloud Gate underwent a five-stage process, required to produce the sculpture's famed mirror-like finish:[22]
The sculpture was finally completed on August 28, 2005, and officially unveiled on May 15, 2006.[29][30] The cost for the piece was first estimated at $6 million; this had escalated to $11.5 million by the time the park opened in 2004,[31] with the final figure standing at $23 million.[2] No public funds were involved, because all funding came from private individual and corporate donations.[2] The lower 6 feet (1.8 m) of Cloud Gate is wiped down twice a day by hand, while the entire sculpture is cleaned twice a year with 40 U.S. gallons (33 imp gal; 150 L) of liquid detergent. The daily cleanings use a Windex-like solution, while the semi-annual cleanings use Tide.[32]

Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley declared the day of the sculpture's dedication, May 15, 2006, to be "Cloud Gate Day". Kapoor attended the celebration, while Orbert Davis and the Chicago Jazz Philharmonic played the Davis-composed "Fanfare for Cloud Gate".[33] The public took an instant liking to the sculpture, affectionately referring to it as "The Bean".[34] Cloud Gate has become a popular piece of public art,[5][35] and is now a fixture on many souvenirs such as postcards, sweatshirts and posters.[36] It has had tremendous drawing power, attracting locals, tourists and art aficionados alike.[37] The sculpture is the piece by which Kapoor is most identified.[38]
Time describes the piece as an essential photo opportunity and more of a destination than a work of art,[5] and the The New York Times describes it as a "tourist magnet" and an "extraordinary art object".[39][37] USA Today
