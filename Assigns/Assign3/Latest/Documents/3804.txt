NetLogo
NetLogo is a multi-agent programming language and integrated modeling environment.

NetLogo was designed in the spirit of the Logo programming language to be "low threshold and no ceiling," that is to enable easy entry by novices and yet meet the needs of high powered users. The NetLogo environment enables exploration of emergent phenomena. It comes with an extensive models library including models in a variety of domains such as economics, biology, physics, chemistry, psychology and many other natural and social sciences. Beyond exploration, NetLogo enables the quick and easy authoring of models.
It is particularly well suited for modeling complex systems developing over time. Modelers can give instructions to hundreds or thousands of independent "agents" all operating concurrently. This makes it possible to explore the connection between the micro-level behavior of individuals and the macro-level patterns that emerge from the interaction of many individuals.
NetLogo has many thousands of active users. It is freely available from the NetLogo website. NetLogo is in use in a wide variety of educational contexts from elementary school to graduate school. Many teachers make use of NetLogo in their curricula. NetLogo comes bundled with a large library of sample models covering many domains in natural and social science.
NetLogo was designed and authored by Uri Wilensky, director of Northwestern University's Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling. Development has been funded by the National Science Foundation and other foundations.

NetLogo is written in Java and Scala and runs on the Java Virtual Machine. At its core is a hybrid interpreter/compiler that partially compiles user code to JVM bytecode.

Version 4.0.4, released November 2008
Also available is NetLogo 3D Preview 5, which is used for previewing the 3D features that will eventually be imported into the main branch.
