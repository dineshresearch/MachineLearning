Teledildonics
Teledildonics (also known as "cyberdildonics") are electronic sex toys that can be controlled by a computer.[1] Promoters of these devices have claimed since the 1980s they are the "next big thing" in cybersex technology.[2] "Teledildonics" can also refer to the integration of telepresence with sex that these toys make possible â€” the term was coined in 1975 by Ted Nelson[3] in his Computer Lib/Dream Machines.
In its original conception, this technology was to have been used for remote sex (or, at least, remote mutual masturbation), where the physical sensations of touch could be transmitted over a data link between the participants.
Sex toys that can be manipulated remotely by another party are currently coming onto the market.[4] These toys sometimes come with prerecorded movies to which the toys' actions are synchronized by means of a previously-written script. Other products being released fit a new category called bluedildonics, which allow a sex toy to be controlled remotely via a Bluetooth connection.
