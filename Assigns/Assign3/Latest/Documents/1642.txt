Glossary of American football
The following terms are used in American football and Canadian football, but see also the glossary of Canadian football.






Common types of coverage:

First down is the first of the plays; fourth is the last down in American, and third in Canadian, football. A first down occurs after a change of possession of the ball, after advancing the ball 10 yards following a previous first down or after certain penalties.
chop block: Similar to a cut block in which one offensive player blocks a defensive player below the knees and another blocks him above the waist. It is illegal to block low if a team mate is already engaged with the defensive player blocking high to prevent knee and ankle injuries.

down box: The post used with the chain gang to mark the line of scrimmage and designate the current down.
