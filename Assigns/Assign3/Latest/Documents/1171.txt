Latte
A latte (from the Italian caff√® latte, meaning "coffee [and] milk") is a type of coffee drink made with hot milk.

In Italian, latte (IPA:†[ÀàlatÃ™tÃ™e], anglicised as IPA: /Ààl…ëÀête…™/) is simply the word for milk. What in English-speaking countries is now called a latte is shorthand for "caffelatte" or "caffellatte" ("caff√® e latte").[1][2][3][4] The long Italian form literally means "coffee and milk", similar to the French caf√© au lait, the Spanish caf√© con leche and the Portuguese caf√© com leite. Caffelatte is today part of the defined international coffee menu, which also includes cappuccino and espresso.
It has been argued[weasel†words] that the origin of the espresso-based caffe latte in America comes from Caffe Mediterraneum in Berkeley, California‚Äîcreated by then owner Lino Meiorin in 1959. As the sign inside states: "Caffe Latte Invented Here - While Seattle may have made this drink famous, It was invented here at the Caffe Mediterraneum in the late 1950‚Äôs". Lino Meiorin, one of the owners, was the first Italian-trained barista in the Bay Area. Customers were not used to the strong flavor of a traditional Italian cappuccino and would ask Lino for more milk. Speaking in Italian, Lino would tell the barista to put more latte (milk) in their cup. Eventually he put a larger drink on the menu with the same amount of espresso but more steamed milk, and called it a caffe latte. It was originally served in a bowl, but switched to a pint beer glass. Today lattes are often served in a wide mouth cup in order to show off hearts, rosettas and other latte art designs.‚Äù [5] However, according to the Oxford English Dictionary the term caff√® latte was first used in English in 1847 (as caffe latto), and in 1867 as caff√® latte by William Dean Howells in his essay "Italian Journeys".

Extensive write-up in Kenneth Davids' Coffee: A Guide to Buying, Brewing and Enjoying.[7] "At least until recently, ordering a "latte" in Italy got you a puzzled look and a hot glass of milk. The American-style caffe latte did not exist in Italian caffes, except perhaps in a few places dominated by American tourists...Obviously breakfast drinks of this kind have existed in Europe for generations, but the caffe version of this drink is an American invention...."

In Italy, caffe latte is almost always prepared at home, for breakfast only. The coffee is brewed with a stovetop Moka and poured into a cup containing heated milk. (The Moka does not produce true espresso, but rather a double-strength coffee. Also, unlike the international latte drink, the milk in the Italian original is not foamed.)
Outside Italy, a latte is typically prepared with approximately one third espresso and two-thirds steamed milk, with a layer of foamed milk approximately 5†mm (¬º inch) thick on the top. The drink is similar to a cappuccino, the difference being that a cappuccino consists of 1/3 espresso, 1/3 steamed milk and 1/3 foam. A variant on the latte is the flat white, which is served in a smaller ceramic cup with the creamy steamed milk poured over a single-shot of espresso, holding back the lighter froth at the top.
