Paris syndrome
Paris syndrome (French: syndrôme de Paris) is a constellation of symptoms primarily affecting mood which affects visitors working and vacationing in Paris, France. Japanese visitors are observed to be especially susceptible. First noted in Nervure, the French journal of psychiatry, by A. Viala, et al. in 2004,[1] it is classified as a form of Stendhal syndrome (Syndrome du voyageur). From the estimated six million yearly visitors the number of reported cases is significant.
The authors of the journal cite the following matters as factors that combine to induce the phenomenon:
However, Youcef Mahmoudia, physician with the Hôtel-Dieu de Paris, indicates that Paris Syndrome is "a manifestation of psychopathology related to the voyage, rather than a syndrome of the traveller".[2] He theorized that the excitement resulting from visiting Paris causes the heart to accelerate, causing giddiness and shortness of breath, which results in hallucinations in the manner that Italian psychologist Graziella Magherini noted in her 1989 book La sindrome di Stendhal.[3]
