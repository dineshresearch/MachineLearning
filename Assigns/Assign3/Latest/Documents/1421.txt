The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (Russian: "–ü—Ä–æ—Ç–æ–∫–æ–ª—ã —Å–∏–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö –º—É–¥—Ä–µ—Ü–æ–≤", or "–°–∏–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–æ–∫–æ–ª—ã"†; see also other titles) is a tract alleging a Jewish and Masonic plot to achieve world domination. Purportedly written by a secret group of Jews known as the Elders of Zion[1], the document underlies 24 protocols that are supposedly followed by the Jewish people. The Protocols has been proven to be a forgery,[2][3][4] a fraud[5][6] and a hoax,[7][8] as well as a clear case of plagiarism.[9]

The original source has been clearly identified as an 1864 book by Maurice Joly entitled The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu, which was written as a satirical attack against the ambitions and methods of French Emperor Napoleon III.[10] In the book, Machiavelli represented Napoleon III, and described a series of steps that he intended to take to become ruler of the world. The Joly book was in turn based on material borrowed from a popular novel of the time by Eug√®ne Sue entitled The Mysteries of the People, in which those plotting to rule the world were the Jesuits instead of Napoleon III. Neither the Joly book nor the Sue book mentioned either Jews or Masons.
Based on evidence repeatedly corroborated by British, German, Ukranian, Polish and Russian sources over a 75 year period, The Protocols, far from being a "discovered" document as it was claimed to be, was in fact deliberately fabricated sometime between 1895 and 1902 by Russian journalist Matvei Golovinski. There are unconfirmed indications that the forgery was created at the direction of Pyotr Rachkovsky, head of the Paris branch of the Russian secret police.[11]
The source material for the forgery was a synthesis between Joly's book and a chapter from a work of fiction titled Biarritz, which was written in 1868 by antisemitic German novelist Hermann Goedsche and translated into Russian in 1872.[12] In creating the Protocols, Golovinski took Joly's novel and changed the plotters from Napoleon III to the Jews, just as Joly had changed the plotters from the Jesuits to Napoleon III in his version of the story. The current belief is the forgery was initiated and authorized by factions of the Russian aristocracy opposed to the political and social reforms initiated by the previous Tsar, (Alexander II). The fabricated document was meant to convince the antisemitic Tsar Nicholas II not to allow additional reforms, since all reforms would play into the hands of this just uncovered "secret Jewish plot". Once the Russian Revolution began in 1905, however, the use of the forgery changed. The same group, now part of the White movement, disseminated the document during their 18 year fight against the Bolsheviks in an attempt to link the Red Army, which had a few Jews in its leadership, to the fictitious Jewish conspiracy.

The text is alternatively known in English as:
The variations in title derive partly from the fact that the book has two titles in Russian: –°–∏–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–æ–∫–æ–ª—ã (Sionskiye protokoly, lit. "Protocols of Zion") and –ü—Ä–æ—Ç–æ–∫–æ–ª—ã —Å–∏–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö –º—É–¥—Ä–µ—Ü–æ–≤ (Protokoly sionskih mudretsov, lit. "Protocols of the Sages of Zion"), and because of the several possible translations from the Russian. "–º—É–¥—Ä–µ—Ü" (mudrets), in English, can be "wise man" or "sage"; "–ü—Ä–æ—Ç–æ–∫–æ–ª—ã" can also be translated, in English, not only to the most literal "protocol," but also to "minutes," "rules," "code," "log," or "etiquette (to list just a few)." [13][14][15]
Variations in the book's title also stem from various (often anonymous) compilers or editors deciding on different main titles (as distinct from subtitles) to advertise or suit particular antisemitic agendas. Too, although the text‚Äîwhich consists roughly of no more than two or three dozen paragraphs‚Äî is only sufficient for a pamphlet, it can become a "book" by expansion, with prefaces, introductions, addenda, etc.
For example, the first American English language edition, published in Boston in 1920 by Small, Maynard & Company, has the following full title: The Protocols and World Revolution Including a Translation and Analysis of the "Protocols of the Meetings of the Zionist Men of Wisdom". Only pages 11 through 73 contain the so-called Protocols. The word "Zion" in this edition has not been used; rather, the word "Zionist" is used. This contrasts to a similar practice of the prior Russian editions. For example, in 1905 Sergei Nilus's book on the imminent arrival of the anti-Christ The Big within the Small, the Protocols constituted the final twelfth chapter.

The forgery contains numerous elements typical of what is known in literature as a "False Document" a document that is deliberately written to fool the reader into believing that what is written is truthful and accurate even though, in actuality, it is not.[16] It is also one of the best-known and most-discussed examples of literary forgery, with analysis and proof of its fraudulent origin going as far back as 1921.[17] The forgery is also an early example of "Conspiracy Theory" literature.[18] Written in the first person singular, the text embodies generalizations, truisms and platitudes on how to take over the world: take control of the media and the financial institutions, change the traditional social order, etc. It does not contain specifics.

The forgery typically consists of 24 to 27 paragraphs or sections entitled "Protocols". It has been published and distributed in many forms: manuscript, periodical, booklet, book and via the internet. It was first edited and disseminated to the public in 1903 by Pavel Krushevan, the instigator of the Kishinev pogrom. It was re-published in 1906-1907 by the Union of the Russian People, a part of the pro-Tsarist antisemitic group The Black Hundreds, as a pamphlet entitled Enemies of the Human Race. The pamphlet was published specifically to blame the Jews for Russia's embarrassing defeat in the Russo-Japanese War. It was similarly used in opposition to the Russian Revolution of 1905, the October Revolution (1917), and the peace negotiations at the end of World War I, becoming known worldwide during the 1919-1920 period when it was widely circulated in the West.
It was first published in the English language in 1919 as two newspaper articles in the Philadelphia Public Ledger by journalist Carl W. Ackerman, but all references to Jews were replaced by references to Bolsheviks and Bolshevism.[19] Its first publication in the United States in its original antisemitic form was in 1920 in "The Dearborn Independent", a newspaper owned and controlled by Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company.

Elements of the text in the Protocols were plagiarizations from the 1864 book, Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu (Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu), written by the French satirist Maurice Joly. Joly's work attacks the political ambitions of Napoleon III using Machiavelli as a diabolical plotter in Hell as a stand-in for Napoleon's views. Joly himself appears to have borrowed material from a popular novel by Eug√®ne Sue, The Mysteries of the People, in which the plotters were Jesuits. Jews do not appear in either work. Since it was illegal to criticize the monarchy, Joly had the pamphlet printed in Belgium, then tried to smuggle it back into France. The police confiscated as many copies as they could, and it was banned. After it was traced to Joly, he was tried on April 25, 1865, and sentenced to 15 months in prison at Sainte-Pelagie. Joly committed suicide in 1878.

Hermann Goedsche's 1868 novel, Biarritz (in English as To Sedan) contributed another idea that may have inspired the scribe behind the Protocols. In the chapter, ‚ÄúThe Jewish Cemetery in Prague and the Council of Representatives of the Twelve Tribes of Israel‚Äù, Goedsche wrote about a nocturnal meeting between members of a mysterious rabbinical cabal, describing how at midnight, the Devil appears before those who have gathered on behalf of the Twelve Tribes of Israel to plan a ‚ÄúJewish conspiracy‚Äù. His depiction is also similar to the scene in Alexandre Dumas, p√®re's Joseph Balsamo, where Cagliostro and company plot the affair of the diamond necklace. With Biarritz appearing at about the same time as The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu, it is possible that Goedsche was inspired by the ideas in Joly's pamphlet, especially in detailing the outcome of the cabal's secret meeting.[20]
Goedsche, a reactionary to the revolutions of 1848, lost his job in the Prussian postal service after forging evidence to implicate democratic leader Benedict Waldeck of conspiring against the king. Following his dismissal, Goedsche began a career as a conservative columnist, while also producing literary work under the pen name Sir John Retcliffe.[21] Goedsche was allegedly a spy for the Prussian Secret Police.[22] In 1871, the story was being presented in France as serious history. In 1872, ‚ÄúThe Jewish Cemetery in Prague‚Äù, translated into Russian, appeared in St. Petersburg as a separate pamphlet of purported non-fiction. Fran√ßois Bournand, in his Les Juifs et nos contemporains (1896), reproduced a speech from the chapter as that of a Chief Rabbi ‚ÄúJohn Readcliff‚Äù.

The 24 Protocols are posited as instructions to a newly-initiated Elder, outlining how the group will control the world. The Elders want to trick all "gentile nations", whom they call "goyim", into doing their will. Their preferred methods include:
