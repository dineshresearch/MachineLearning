Foreign branding
Foreign branding is an advertising and marketing term describing the implied cachet or superiority of products and services with foreign or foreign-sounding names.

In English-speaking countries, many cosmetics and fashion brands use French or Italian-styled names to imply a connection to the style-conscious, while northern European and Japanese names imply high quality and efficiency.



Foreign alphabets and diacritical marks (such as the umlaut) are often used to give a foreign flavor to a brand that does not consist of foreign terms.
