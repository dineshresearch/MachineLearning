Windows-1252
Windows-1252 (also known as WinLatin1) is a character encoding of the Latin alphabet, used by default in the legacy components of Microsoft Windows in English and some other Western languages. It is one version within the group of Windows code pages. In LaTeX packages, it is referred to as ansinew. The encoding is a superset of ISO 8859-1, but differs from the IANA's ISO-8859-1 by using displayable characters rather than control characters in the 0x80 to 0x9F range. It is known to Windows by the code page number 1252, and by the IANA-approved name "windows-1252". This code page also contains all the printable characters that are in ISO 8859-15 (though some are mapped to different code points).
The use of Unicode (often in UTF-8 form) is slowly replacing use of 8-bit "code pages" such as Windows-1252.
Many web browsers and email clients treat the MIME charset ISO-8859-1 as Windows-1252, and so codes from it are often seen in web pages that declare their encoding erroneously as ISO-8859-1. However, there can be difficulties from the use of such characters, particularly when the recipient is using a non-Windows system, or systems that attempt to fully implement the standards.
The term "ANSI code page" is also used to refer to code pages used in Windows, like Windows-1252. Even though Windows-1252 is considered an ANSI code page in Microsoft Windows parlance, the code page has never been standardized by ANSI. The name has been taken from an early ANSI draft, that later was modified and became ISO-8859-1. Thus, Windows-1252 is a non-standard code page and is called an ANSI code page for historical reasons. Microsoft has stated that "The term ANSI as used to signify Windows code pages is a historical reference, but is nowadays a misnomer that continues to persist in the Windows community"[1].
