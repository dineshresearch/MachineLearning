Finnish profanity
Many Finns frequently use profanity in everyday speech. While not all Finns swear, frequent swearing is a mark of youth culture. However, it is commonly considered impolite to swear excessively, in public and official occasions and particularly in front of children.
Finnish swearwords can be used as adjectives or adverbs with proper conjugation, just as the English swear words "fuck" or "shit" can become the descriptives "fucking" or "shitty."
The words often have old origins, and some have Pagan roots, that after Christian influence were turned from names of deities and spirits to profanity and used as such. Nowadays few Finns know of the origins and intended original use of the words.
The people in the neighbouring countries to Finland often consider Finnish swear words harsher than their own, and even use heavily mis-pronounced versions of them, most notably perkele. Native Finns tend to consider the harshness exaggerated, while others use it to their advantage.
There is also a book made by Jari Tammi named 'Suuri kirosanakirja' ("The great book of profanity"), which is literally a list of Finnish swear words. The book is published by WSOY, and the first edition was published in 1993.
Additionally, virtually any word can be used in place of profanity by for example preceding it with "voi" or adding "vieköön". These were more prominent in older Finnish, e.g. raato "dead body" or peto "predator". There are also other similar non-offensive constructs like taivahan talikynttilät ("tallow candles of heaven"). There is also an inventory of non-offensive curse words.
