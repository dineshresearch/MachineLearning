Jack Harkness
Captain Jack Harkness is a fictional character played by John Barrowman in Doctor Who and its spin-off series, Torchwood. He first appears in the 2005 Doctor Who episode "The Empty Child" and reappears throughout the remaining episodes of the 2005 series as a companion of the ninth incarnation of the series' protagonist the Doctor. Jack goes on to become the central character in Torchwood, an adult-themed spin-off of Doctor Who. He returns in the 2007 series of Doctor Who, reuniting with the tenth incarnation of the Doctor, and returned again for the 2008 series.
In the programme's narrative, Jack is a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century. A bisexual, he is the first openly non-heterosexual character in the history of televised Doctor Who. In contrast to the Doctor, Jack is a man of action, more willing to see the hands-on solution to the problem at hand. As a consequence of his death and resurrection in the 2005 series finale of Doctor Who, the character becomes immortal, a lasting change throughout his appearances in both series. Jack eventually becomes the leader of Torchwood, a British organisation dedicated to combating alien threats. Adding another layer to the character is a vague backstory which is gradually revealed as both programmes progress.
The popularity of the character amongst multiple demographics directly influenced the development of the spin-off series Torchwood, in which Jack is the lead amongst an ensemble cast. The character became a figure of the British public consciousness, rapidly gaining fame for portrayer John Barrowman. As an ongoing depiction of bisexuality in mainstream British television, the character became a role model for young gay and bisexual people in the UK. Jack is featured in the pages of various Doctor Who and Torchwood books, as well as having children's action figures created in his likeness from early appearances in Doctor Who.


Jack first appeared in the 2005 Doctor Who episode "The Empty Child" and its continuation "The Doctor Dances", when Rose (Billie Piper), a companion of the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston), meets him during the Blitz. Posing as an American volunteering in the Royal Air Force, Jack is a former "Time Agent" from the 51st century who left after inexplicably losing two years of his memory. He became a con man, and is unwittingly responsible for releasing a plague.[1][2] After the Doctor cures this plague, Jack redeems himself by displacing an unexploded bomb in his ship, and is rescued moments before it explodes by the Doctor and Rose in the TARDIS.[3][4][5] During his time with the Doctor, Jack matures into a hero,[6] and in his final 2005 appearance, he sacrifices himself fighting the Daleks; Rose brings him back to life while suffused with the power of the time vortex.[5] He is then left behind by the Doctor and Rose, who depart Satellite 5 in the TARDIS. The decision behind Jack's absence in the 2006 series of Doctor Who was so that the effects of the Doctor's regeneration on Rose could be explored.[7]
The character returned in 2006 as the star of the spin-off series Torchwood, where he leads the Cardiff-based Torchwood Three, battling alien threats. A changed man,[8] Jack became immortal after his resurrection and spent years on Earth waiting to reunite with the Doctor. Jack recruits policewoman Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) to his team;[9] and there are hints of romantic feelings between them,[10] however Jack begins a sexual relationship with existing employee Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd).[11] Despite having worked with him for some time, his present-day colleagues know very little about him;[12] over the course of the season they discover that he cannot die, and that "Jack Harkness" is not in fact his true name, but an alias taken from a deceased WWII soldier.[13] The audience also comes to learn Jack was once a prisoner of war,[13] and was an interrogator who used torture.[14] In the Torchwood Series One finale "End of Days",[15] Jack returns to the TARDIS, and in the 2007 Doctor Who episode "Utopia", the character meets the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) and his companion Martha (Freema Agyeman). Jack explains he returned from Satellite 5 to the present day by travelling to 1869 via vortex manipulator, and lived through the 20th century waiting for the Doctor.[16] By the series finale, having spent a year in an alternate timeline enslaved by the Master (John Simm), Jack opts to return to his team in Cardiff. Before departing, Jack's speculation about his never-ending aging and reminiscence of his youthful nickname suggests to the audience that he may one day become the mysterious "Face of Boe" (a recurring character voiced by Struan Rodger).[17][18]
In 2008, Torchwood Series Two began with Jack returning to his team to find they have moved on without him, with Gwen leading the team. Returning with a new attitude,[19][20] Jack finds his team more insistent to learn of his past after meeting his former partner, the villainous Captain John Hart (James Marsters).[21] The episode "Adam" explores Jack's childhood in the Boeshane Peninsula, revealing through flashback sequences how his father Franklin (Demetri Goritsas) died and a young Jack (Jack Montgomery) lost his younger brother Gray (Ethan Brooke) during an alien invasion after releasing his hand.[22] The series' penultimate episode "Fragments" features flashback scenes depicting Jack's capture by Torchwood in the late 19th century. Initially their prisoner, Jack is contracted into becoming a freelance agent for the organisation, eventually appointed the leader of Torchwood Three at midnight on 1 January 2000.[23] The series finale featured the return of Captain John and Jack's brother Gray (Lachlan Nieboer), who after a lifetime of torture returns with a vendetta against Jack. Jack is eventually forced to place Gray in cryogenic stasis, and while somewhat repairing his friendship with Captain John, must also mourn the deaths of teammates Toshiko (Naoko Mori) and Owen (Burn Gorman) at Gray's hand.[24] Jack appears alongside the casts of Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures in the two-part crossover finale of the 2008 series of Doctor Who. In "The Stolen Earth", Jack is summoned alongside fellow companions Martha and Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) to face the threat of the Daleks' creator Davros (Julian Bleach).[25] The next episode sees him part company from the Doctor once again, with Martha and Mickey (Noel Clarke) in tow, having helped save the universe from destruction.[26]
The third series of Torchwood is expected to air as a five-part serial in 2009, titled Children of Earth.[27][28] The third series will introduce Alice (Lucy Cohu), Captain Jack's daughter.[29] Director Euros Lyn promises that "the love story between Captain Jack and Ianto continues to unfold".[30] Lyn comments that the audience will learn more about "the nature of [Jack and Ianto's] relationship", as well as glimpse details about the "terrible things Jack's done in the past."[31]

Jack does not feature on the cover of the Doctor Who books in which he appears, but is visible alongside the Torchwood cast on the cover of each Torchwood novel and audiobook. Jack features in the BBC Books "New Series Adventures" Doctor Who novels The Deviant Strain,[32] The Stealers of Dreams,[33] and Only Human.[34] These novels take place between episodes of the 2005 series of Doctor Who. In The Stealers of Dreams, Jack refers to the Face of Boe as a famous figure in his home era; the producers of the series had not conceptualised the possibility of a Jack and Boe connection until mid-way into the production of the 2007 series.[18] Captain Jack also appears in the BBC Books Torchwood series of novels. The first wave, Another Life,[35] Border Princes,[36] and Slow Decay,[37] were published in January 2007 and were set between episodes of the first series of Torchwood.
Published in March 2008, and tying in with the concurrently airing second series of Torchwood, Jack appears in the novels Trace Memory,[38] The Twilight Streets,[39] and Something in the Water.[40] The Twilight Streets offers some revelations about the character of Jack in other periods, although with all Doctor Who and Torchwood spin-off media, the canonicity in relation to the television series is debated by some fans.[41] The Twilight Streets suggests Jack was a freelance Torchwood agent in the 1940s, who disagreed with their methods but was persuaded by the love of an ex-boyfriend, Greg. The novel also explained that during the events of the Doctor Who episode "Boom Town" (which was set in Cardiff),[3] Jack placed a lockdown on Torchwood activity so as not to create a paradox. Trace Memory similarly depicts Jack as a freelance Torchwood agent, living and working in the late 1960s. Three more Torchwood books were released in October 2008: Pack Animals,[42] SkyPoint,[43] and Almost Perfect, the last of which is set after the series two finale "Exit Wounds".[44] The May 2009 wave of books will be Into the Silence,[45] Bay of the Dead,[46] and The House that Jack Built.[47] The House that Jack Built will focus partly on Jack's life in 1906. First published in January 2008, the monthly Torchwood Magazine began occasionally including Torchwood comic strips, in which Jack also appears. One such comic, written in 2009 by John Barrowman called "Captain Jack and the Selkie", is a story which Barrowman worked on with his sister which expands on Captain Jack's characterisation. Barrowman comments that "We’d already agreed to tell a story that showed a side of Jack and a part of his history that hadn’t been explored too much in other media. I wanted to give fans something original about Jack."[48][49]
Airing during Series One of Torchwood, the Torchwood website located at Torchwood.org.uk recounted some adventures by Captain Jack through an alternate reality game made up of electronic literature in the form of fictional incercepted blogs, newspaper cutouts and confidential letters and IM conversations between members of the Torchwood Three crew. Written by James Goss, the first series' website (archived here, August 24 2007) sheds some light on Jack's backstory in the years he worked for Torchwood.[50] For Series Two in 2008, a second interactive Torchwood online game was devised, scripted by series writer Phil Ford, and as with the 2006 website contained some information on Jack's unseen adventures.[51] The BBC America Torchwood also has a 'Captain's Blog' section which relays Jack's accounts of the events of each episode.[52]The Torchwood Archives by Gary Russell collects much of this online literature for the first two series in hardback form, including the Captain's Blog section of the BBC America website, as well as original material, such as rough dates for things like Jack's marriage as relayed by the book's fictional narrator.[53] During series 4 of Doctor Who, the BBC's website also included a section called "Captain Jack's Monster Files" featuring weekly videos narrated by John Barrowman in character as Captain Jack giving "top secret" facts collected by Torchwood about Doctor Who monsters, such as the Slitheen.[54] A Christmas special 2008 Monster File features Barrowman in new footage as Jack,[55] as does the Cybermen edition added following the airing of "The Next Doctor" on Christmas Day.[56]

In addition to the paperback novels, Jack also appears in Torchwood audio books, the first two being Hidden written by Steven Savile and narrated by Naoko Mori,[57] Everyone Says Hello written by Dan Abnett and narrated by Burn Gorman,[58] released February 2008, and forthcoming In the Shadows by Joseph Lidster, released September 2008.[59] Joseph Lidster also wrote a BBC Radio 4 Torchwood drama, "Lost Souls" which aired in Summer 2008 as an Afternoon Play featuring the voices of John Barrowman, Eve Myles, Gareth David-Lloyd and Freema Agyeman. Set after the events of the 2008 series, Jack and his team make their first international adventure to CERN in Geneva, as part of Radio 4's special celebration of the Large Hadron Collider being switched on.[60][61] The special radio episode's plot focuses on the Large Hadron Collider's activation and the doomsday scenario some predicted it might incite, as well as the team's mourning of Toshiko and Owen's recent deaths.[62]


——John Barrowman[63]
In naming the character, executive producer and head writer Russell T Davies drew inspiration from the Marvel Comics character Agatha Harkness,[64] a character whose surname Davies had previously used in naming lead characters in Century Falls and The Grand. Jack's original appearances in Doctor Who were conceived with the intention of forming a character arc in which Jack is transformed from a coward to a hero,[6] and John Barrowman consciously minded this in his portrayal of the character.[63] Following on that arc, the character's debut episode would leave his morality as ambiguous, publicity materials asking, "Is he a force for good or ill?"[65]
John Barrowman himself was a key factor in the conception of Captain Jack. Barrowman says that at the time of his initial casting, Davies and co-executive producer, Julie Gardner had explained to him that they "basically wrote the character around [John]".[66] John recounts Davies as having been searching for an actor with a "matinée idol quality", telling him that "the only one in the whole of Britain who could do it was you". A number of television critics have likened Barrowman's performance as Captain Jack to those of Hollywood actor Tom Cruise.[67][68][69][70]
The character's introduction served to posit him as a secondary hero and a rival to the series protagonist, the Doctor,[71] simultaneously paralleling the Doctor's detached alien nature with Jack's humanity and "heart".[72] John Barrowman describes the character in his initial appearance as "an intergalactic conman" and also a "rogue Time Agent" which he defines as "part of a kind of space CIA" and alludes to the moral ambiguity of having "done something in his past" and not knowing "whether it is good or bad because his memory has been erased.[71] Writer Stephen James Walker finds that similarities between Jack and Angel, the heroic vampire from America's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, have been noted; Alan Stanley Blair of SyFy Portal pointed out that "Back alley fights, knowledge of the paranormal and an unwanted task of defending the helpless are only a few of the correlations between the two characters."[73][74] In another contrast, where the Doctor is a pacifist, Jack is more inclined to see violent means to reach similar ends. The BBC News website refers to Jack's role within Doctor Who as "[continuing] what began with Ian Chesterton and continued later with
