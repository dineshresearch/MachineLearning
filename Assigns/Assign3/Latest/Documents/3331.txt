Panko
Panko (パン粉 ?) is a variety of breadcrumb from Japanese cuisine and French cuisine used to create a crunchy coating for fried foods such as tonkatsu. Panko is made from bread without crusts, thus it has a crisper, airier texture than most types of breading found in Western cuisine. Outside Japan, it is becoming more popular for use in Asian and non-Asian dishes, and is often available in Asian markets and specialty stores. Increasingly, it's also available in many large supermarkets. Panko is produced worldwide, particularly in Asian countries including Japan, Korea, Thailand, China and Vietnam.
