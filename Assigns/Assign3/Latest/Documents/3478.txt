Security Identifier
In the context of the Microsoft Windows NT line of operating systems, a Security Identifier (commonly abbreviated SID) is a unique name (an alphanumeric character string) which is assigned by a Windows Domain controller during the log on process that is used to identify a subject, such as a user or a group of users in a network of NT/2000 systems.

Windows grants or denies access and privileges to resources based on access control lists (ACLs), which use SIDs to uniquely identify users and their group memberships. When a user logs into a computer, an access token is generated that contains user and group SIDs and user privilege level. When a user requests access to a resource, the access token is checked against the ACL to permit or deny particular action on a particular object.
SIDs are useful for troubleshooting issues with security audits, Windows server and domain migrations.
SID has format as follows: S-1-5-21-7623811015-3361044348-030300820-1013
Possible identifier authority values are:

A number of "well-known" security identifiers are defined by the operating system so as to ensure that specific system accounts can always be found. Microsoft maintains a complete list of these identifiers in a knowledge base article.[1]

The problem with duplicated SIDs in a Workgroup of computers running Windows NT/2K/XP is only related to different user accounts having the same SID. This could lead to unexpected access to shared files or files stored on a removable storage: If some ACLs (Access control lists) are set on a file, the actual permissions can be associated with a user SID. If this user SID is duplicated on another computer (because the computer SID is duplicated and because the user SIDs are built based on the computer SID + a sequential number), a user of a second computer having the same SID could have access to the files that the user of a first computer has protected.
Now the truth is that when the computers are joined into a domain (Active Directory or NT domain for instance), each computer has a unique Domain SID which is recomputed each time a computer enters a domain. Thus there are usually no real problems with Duplicated SIDs when the computers are members of a domain, especially if local user accounts are not used. If local user accounts are used, there is a potential security issue that is the same as the one described above when the computers are members of a Workgroup but that affects only the files and resources protected by local users, not by domain users.
In other words, duplicated SIDs are usually not a problem with Microsoft Windows systems. However Microsoft does provide a utility to change a machine SID: NewSID - Microsoft TechNet
But other programs that detect SIDs might have problems with its security.

The machine SID is stored in the SECURITY registry hive located at SECURITY\SAM\Domains\Account, this key has two values F and V. The V value is a binary value that has the computer SID embedded within it at the end of its data (Last 96 bits).[2]

regedit.exe -> \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM\SAM\Domains\Account\V (last 12 bytes) explorer.exe -> \%windir%\system32\config\SAM If the SAM file is missing at startup, a backup is retrieved in hexidecimal form here: regedit.exe -> \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\PolAcDmS\@ (last 12 bytes) explorer.exe -> \%windir%\system32\config\SECURITY Sometimes the SID number is referenced in decimal form.
