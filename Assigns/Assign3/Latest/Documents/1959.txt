Rhetorical device
In rhetoric, a rhetorical device or resource of language is a technique that an author or speaker uses to evoke an emotional response in the audience (the reader(s) or listener(s)). These emotional responses are central to the meaning of the work or speech, and should also get the audience's attention. Usage of rhetorical device techniques can give an auxiliary meaning, idea, or feeling to the literal or written.
