Recovery Is Possible
Recovery Is Possible (RIPLinux) is a small, specialized Linux distribution that includes a large number of system maintenance and recovery applications on a live CD. The disc is mainly oriented towards the experienced Linux user, and thus does not contain automated scripts for many common tasks (such as undeleting files, creating partitions, and the like). The RIP disc comes in two flavors: one with the X Window System and one without; usually, the non-X disc is released a few days after the X distribution as the author takes time to compile and quickly test the build. The X-capable version does not require X to be started at boot-up; it can be started at any time after booting without the server. The main purpose of X under RIP is to provide the capability to run GParted, a disk partition management program, and Mozilla Firefox, a web browser. MPlayer is also included and Firefox is shipped with the MPlayer plug-in extension to allow most embedded media on the web to be viewed.
