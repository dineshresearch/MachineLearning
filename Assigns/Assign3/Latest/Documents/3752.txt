Curitiba
Curitiba (pron. IPA:†[ku…æi'tib…ê] or IPA:†[ku…æi't Éib…ê]) is the capital city of the Brazilian state of Paran√°. The city has the largest population and also the largest economy in Southern Brazil. The population of Curitiba numbers approximately 1.8 million people (7th largest nationwide) and the latest GDP figures for the city surpass US$17 billion (ranking 4th nationwide) according to IBGE.[1]
Its metropolitan area comprises 26 municipalities[2] with a total population of over 3.5 million (IBGE estimate in 2006).[3] Curitiba is an important cultural, political and economic center in the country. The city sits on a plateau at 932†metres (3,060†ft) above sea level. It is located 105†kilometres (65†mi) west of the sea port of Paranagu√° and hosts the Afonso Pena International Airport.
Growth was based on the cattle trade, being half way between cattle breeding country to the South and markets to the North. Waves of European immigrants started arriving after 1850, mainly Germans, Italians, Poles and Ukrainians contributing to the economic and cultural development of the city.[4]
Currently, only small numbers of foreigners migrate to Curitiba, and these are mainly immigrants from Middle Eastern[5] and South American countries, but there is a substantial inward flow of Brazilians from other States of the country (it is estimated that nowadays about half the population of Curitiba was not born in the city).[6]
Curitiba hosts the Universidade Federal do Paran√° (Federal University of Paran√°), the first in Brazil, was established in Curitiba in 1913, the same year in which electric streetcars were first deployed.

One theory about the name "Curitiba" comes from the Tupi words kur√≠ tyba, "many pine" due to the large number of Parana pines (Araucaria angustifolia), in the region prior to its foundation.[7] The Portuguese who founded a village in 1693 gave it the name of "Vila da Nossa Senhora da Luz dos Pinhais" (Our Lady of the Light in the Pine Forest). The name was changed to "Curitiba" in 1721. 	 Curitiba officially became a town in 1812, spelling its name as Curityba. An alternative spelling also came up: Coritiba. This spelling looked to become dominant for it was used in press and state documents, but a state decree in 1919 settled the dispute by spelling the city name Curitiba.[7]
