Business Plot
The Business Plot (also the Plot Against FDR and the White House Putsch) was a political conspiracy alleged by retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler, who testified to the McCormack-Dickstein Congressional Committee that a group of men had approached him as part of a plot to overthrow United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a military coup.[1] One of the purported plotters, Gerald MacGuire, vehemently denied any such plot. In their report, the Congressional committee stated that it was able to confirm Butler's statements other than the proposal from MacGuire. [2] No prosecutions or further investigations followed, and historians[3][4][5][6] and contemporary journalists[7] largely rejected the idea that any such plan was near execution, with the New York Times characterizing it as a "gigantic hoax."[8]

On July 17, 1932, thousands of World War I veterans converged on Washington, D.C., set up tent camps, and demanded immediate payment of bonuses due them according to the Adjusted Service Certificate Law of 1924. This "Bonus Army" was led by Walter W. Waters, a former Army sergeant. The Army was encouraged by an appearance from retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler, who had considerable influence over the veterans, being one of the most popular military figures of the time.[citation needed] A few days after Butler's arrival, President Herbert Hoover ordered the marchers removed, and their camps were destroyed by US Army cavalry troops under the command of General Douglas MacArthur.
Butler, although a self-described Republican, responded by supporting Roosevelt in that year's election.[9]
In a 1995 History Today article Clayton Cramer argued that the devastation of the Great Depression had caused many Americans to question the foundations of liberal democracy. "Many traditionalists, here and in Europe, toyed with the ideas of Fascism and National Socialism; many liberals dallied with Socialism and Communism." Cramer argues that this explains why some American business leaders viewed fascism as a viable system to both preserve their interests and end the economic woes of the Depression.[10][unreliable source?][dead link]

On July 1, 1933, first Butler meeting with MacGuire and Doyle. Gerald C. MacGuire was a $100 a week bond salesman for Murphy & Company,[11][12] former commander of the Connecticut American Legion[13][14] who had been an activist for the gold currency movement that Robert Sterling Clark sponsored.[citation needed] Bill Doyle was commander of the Massachusetts American Legion.[15]
Butler stated he was asked to run for National Commander of the American Legion. [16] On July 3 or 4, second meeting with MacGuire and Doyle. He stated they offered to get hundreds of supporters at the American Legion convention to ask for a speech.[17] Around August 1 MacGuire visits Butler alone. Butler states that MacGuire told him Col.Murphy underwrote the formation of the American Legion in New York, and Butler told MacGuire that the American Legion was "nothing but a strike breaking outfit."[18] Butler never sees Doyle again.
September 24[19][20] |MacGuire visits Butler's hotel room in Newark.[21] Late-September Butler meets with Robert Clark.[22] Robert Sterling Clark was an art collector who lived mostly in Paris,[citation needed] one of Wall Street's richest investors,[citation needed] and heir to the Singer Sewing Machine fortune.[23][24] MacGuire had known Robert S. Clark when he was a Second Lieutenant in China during the Boxer Rebellion. Clark had been nicknamed "the millionaire lieutenant.[24]
First half of 1934 MacGuire travels to Europe, sends Butler postal cards [25] March 6 MacGuire writes Clark and Clark's attorney letter describing the Croix de Feu[26] August 22 Butler meets MacGuire at a Hotel. Last time Butler meets MacGuire[27][28] September 13 undercover reporter French meets MacGuire in his office[29] Late September Butler tells Van Zandt that conspirators will meet him at upcoming Veterans of Foreign Wars convention. November 20, Committee begins examining evidence. Paul Comly French breaks the story in the Philadelphia Record and the New York Post.[30] November 21 â€“ November 22, The New York Times writes its first article on the story and criticizes it as a "gigantic hoax."

The Committee began examining evidence a year later, on November 20, 1934. On November 24 the committee released a statement detailing the testimony it had heard about the plot and its preliminary findings. On February 15, 1935, the committee submitted to the House of Representatives its final report.[31]
During the McCormack-Dickstein Committee hearings, Butler testified that through MacGuire and Bill Doyle, who was then the department commander of the American Legion in Massachusetts,[32] the conspirators attempted to recruit him to lead a coup, promising him an army of 500,000 men for a march on Washington, D.C., and $30 million in financial backing. [33] Butler testified that the pretext for the coup would be that the president's health was failing.[34]
Despite Butler's support for Roosevelt in the election,[9] and his reputation as a strong critic of capitalism,[35] Butler said the plotters felt his good reputation and popularity were vital in attracting support amongst the general public, and saw him as easier to manipulate than others.
Though Butler had never spoken to them, Butler said that Al Smith, Roosevelt's political foe and former governor of New York, and IrÃ©nÃ©e du Pont, a chemical industrialist, were the financial and organizational backbone of the plot.[citation needed] The committee chose not to publish these allegations because they were hearsay.[36] Butler stated that once the conspirators were in power, they would protect Roosevelt from other plotters.[37]
Given a successful coup, Butler said that the plan was for him to have held near-absolute power in the newly created position of "Secretary of General Affairs," while Roosevelt would have assumed a figurehead role.
Those implicated in the plot by Butler all denied any involvement. MacGuire was the only figure identified by Butler who testified before the committee. Others Butler accused were not called to appear to testify because the "committee has had no evidence before it that would in the slightest degree warrant calling before it such men... The committee will not take cognizance of names brought into testimony which constitute mere hearsay."[36]
In response, Butler said that the committee had deliberately edited out of its published findings the leading business people whom he had named in connection with the plot.[38] He said on February 17, 1935 on Radio WCAU, "Like most committees it has slaughtered the little and allowed the big to escape. The big shots weren't even called to testify. They were all mentioned in the testimony. Why was all mention of these names suppressed from the testimony?"[38]
On the final day of the committee.[39] January 29 John L. Spivak published the first of two articles in Communist magazine New Masses, revealing portion of congressional committee testimony that had been redacted as hearsay. Spivak argued that the plot is part of a Fascist conspiracy of financiers and Jews to take over the USA. [31][40]


The Congressional committee report said:

Some parts of Gen. Butler's story were supported by the statements of others. Captain Samuel Glazier testified that he had approached MacGuire at Butler's urging and heard the plans himself.[43][44] Reporter Paul Comly French, reporter for the Philadelphia Record and the New York Evening Post, testified to the same effect.[45] Separately, Veterans of Foreign Wars commander James E. Van Zandt stated that, "Less than two months" after General Butler warned him, "he had been approached by â€˜agents of Wall Streetâ€™ to lead a Fascist dictatorship in the United States under the guise of a â€˜Veterans Organizationâ€™ ".[46]

A New York Times editorial dismissed Butler's story as "a gigantic hoax" and a "bald and unconvincing narrative."[8][47] Thomas W. Lamont of J.P. Morgan called it "perfect moonshine."[47] General Douglas MacArthur, alleged to be the back-up leader of the putsch if Butler declined, referred to it as "the best laugh story of the year."[47] Time Magazine and other publications also scoffed at the allegations.[7][48]


Robert F. Burk said, "At their core, the accusations probably consisted of a mixture of actual attempts at influence peddling by a small core of financiers with ties to veterans organizations and the self-serving accusations of Butler against the enemies of his pacifist and populist causes." [3]
Hans Schmidt said, "Even if Butler was telling the truth, as there seems little reason to doubt, there remains the unfathomable problem of MacGuire's motives and veracity. He may have been working both ends against the middle, as Butler at one point suspected. In any case, MacGuire emerged from the HUAC hearings as an inconsequential trickster whose base dealings could not possibly be taken alone as verifying such a momentous undertaking. If he was acting as an intermediary in a genuine probe, or as agent provocateur sent to fool Butler, his employers were at least clever enough to keep their distance and see to it that he self-destructed on the witness stand." [4]
Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. said, "Most people agreed with Mayor La Guardia of New York in dismissing it as a â€˜cocktail putschâ€™ [49] . . . As for the House committee, headed by John McCormack of Massachusetts, it declared itself "able to verify all the pertinent statements made by General Butler", except for MacGuire's direct proposal to him, and it considered this more or less confirmed by MacGuire's European reports. No doubt, MacGuire did have some wild scheme in mind, though the gap between contemplation and execution was considerable, and it can hardly be supposed that the Republic was in much danger". [5]
Jules Archer spoke to McCormack, whom he characterised as a "veteran politician", an adviser to Roosevelt as well as other presidents.[38] He said McCormack told him, "General Smedley Butler was one of the outstanding Americans in our history. I cannot emphasise too strongly the very important part he played in exposing the Fascist plot in the early 1930s backed by and planned by persons possessing tremendous wealth."[38]
James E. Sargent reviewing The Plot to Seize the White House, by Jules Archer, said, "Thus, Butler (and Archer) assumed that the existence of a financially-backed plot meant that fascism was imminent, and that the planners represented a widespread and coherent group, having both the intent and the capacity to execute their ideas. So, when his testimony was criticized, and even ridiculed, in the media, and ignored in Washington, Butler saw (and Archer sees) conspiracy everywhere. Instead, it is plausible to conclude that the honest and straightforward, but intellectually and politically unsophisticated, Butler perceived in simplistic terms what were, in fact, complex trends and events. Thus, he leaped to the simplistic conclusion that the President and the Republic were in mortal danger. In essence, Archer swallowed his hero whole".[6]

The BBC online prÃ©cis for their documentary program The Whitehouse Coup, says "The coup was aimed at toppling President Franklin D Roosevelt with the help of half-a-million war veterans. The plotters, who were alleged to involve some of the most famous families in America, (owners of Heinz, Birds Eye, Goodtea, Maxwell Hse & George Bushâ€™s Grandfather, Prescott) believed that their country should adopt the policies of Hitler and Mussolini to beat the great depression."[38] In that documentary, author and conspiracy theorist[50] John Buchanan said, "The investigations mysteriously turned to vapor when it comes time to call them to testify. FDR's main interest was getting the New Deal passed, and so he struck a deal in which it was agreed that the plotters would walk free if Wall Street would back off of their opposition to the New Deal and let FDR do what he wanted".[38] The actual progam connected major companies to the American Liberty League, formed by Al Smith, which the program asserted was to be the fascist ruler, and that Prescott Bush was one of the directors of the Hamburg America Line which gave free passage to journalists visiting Germany, and was accused of transporting Nazi spies to the United States.[51]
