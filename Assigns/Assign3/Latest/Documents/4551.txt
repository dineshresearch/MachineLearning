Book of Mormon
The Book of Mormon is a sacred text of the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement. It was first published in March 1830 by Joseph Smith, Jr. as The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi.[1] According to Smith, the book was originally written in otherwise unknown characters referred to as "reformed Egyptian" on golden plates that he discovered in 1823 and then translated. The plates, Smith said, had been buried in a hill near his home in Manchester, New York, where he found them by the guidance of an angel, the spirit of an ancient American prophet-historian, named Moroni.
The Book of Mormon is the earliest of the defining publications of the Latter Day Saint movement. The churches of the movement typically regard the Book of Mormon not only as scripture, but as a historical record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas, written by American prophets from perhaps as early as 2500 B.C. to about 400 A.D.[2]
The Book of Mormon is divided into smaller books, titled after the individuals named as primary authors and, in most versions, divided into chapters and verses. It is written in the same Early Modern English linguistic style as the King James Version of the Bible.[3][4] The Book of Mormon has a number of original and distinctive doctrinal discussions on subjects such as the fall of Adam and Eve[5], the nature of the Atonement[6], eschatology, redemption from physical and spiritual death[7], and the organization of the latter-day church. It also includes social and political commentary.

Joseph Smith Jr. said that when he was seventeen years of age an angel of God, named Moroni, appeared to him[8] and told him that a collection of ancient writings, engraved on golden plates by ancient prophets, was buried in a nearby hill in Wayne County, New York. The writings described a people whom God had led from Jerusalem to the Western Hemisphere 600 years before Jesus’ birth. According to the narrative, Moroni was the last prophet among these people and had buried the record, which God had promised to bring forth in the latter days. Smith stated that he was instructed by Moroni to meet at the hill annually each September 22 to receive further instructions and that four years after the initial visit, in 1827, he was allowed to take the plates and was directed to translate them into English.[9] [10]
Smith's first published description of the plates said that the plates "had the appearance of gold," and were described by Martin Harris, one of Smith's early scribes, to be "fastened together in the shape of a book by wires."[11] Smith called the engraved writing on the plates "reformed Egyptian."[12] A portion of the text on the plates was also "sealed" according to his account, so its presumed content was not included in the Book of Mormon.[13]
In addition to Smith's account regarding the plates, eleven others signed affidavits that they saw and handled the gold plates for themselves. Their written testimonies are known as the Testimony of Three Witnesses[14] and the Testimony of Eight Witnesses.[15] These affidavits are published as part of the introductory pages to the Book of Mormon.
Smith enlisted the help of his neighbor Martin Harris (one of the Three Witnesses), who later mortgaged his farm to underwrite the printing of the Book of Mormon, as a scribe during his initial work on the text. In 1828, Harris, prompted by his wife, Lucy Harris, repeatedly requested that Smith lend him the current pages that had been translated. Smith reluctantly relented to Harris' requests. Lucy Harris is thought to have stolen the first 116 pages.[16] After the loss, Smith recorded that he had lost the ability to translate, and that Moroni had taken back the plates to be returned only after Smith repented.[17][18][19][20] Smith later stated that God allowed him to resume translation, but directed that he begin translating another part of the plates. In 1829, with the assistance of Oliver Cowdery, work on the Book of Mormon recommenced, and was completed in a remarkably short period (April-June 1829).[21] Smith then said he returned the plates to Moroni upon the publication of the book.[18][22]
Critics of the Book of Mormon claim that the book was either an original creation of Smith (with or without the assistance of one or more of his associates),[23][24][25][26][27][28] was based on a prior work such as View of the Hebrews,[24][25][29] or was plagiarized in part from an unpublished manuscript written by Solomon Spalding.[30][31][32] For a few followers of the LDS movement, unresolved issues of the book's historicity and the lack of conclusive archaeological evidence have led them to adopt a compromise position that the Book of Mormon may be the creation of Smith, but that it was nevertheless created through divine inspiration.[33] Most in the LDS movement believe Smith's position that it is a literal historical record.[34]


Smith stated that the title page, and presumably the actual title of the 1830 edition, came from the translation of "the very last leaf" of the golden plates, and was written by the prophet-historian Moroni.[35][36] The title page states that the purpose of the Book of Mormon is "to [show] unto the remnant of the house of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers;...and also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations."[37]

The Book of Mormon is organized as a compilation of smaller "books", each named after its main named narrator or a prominent leader, beginning with the First Book of Nephi (1 Nephi) and ending with the Book of Moroni.
The book's sequence is primarily chronological based on the narrative content of the book. Exceptions include the Words of Mormon and the Book of Ether. The Words of Mormon contains editorial comment by Mormon. The Book of Ether is presented as the narrative of an earlier group of people who had come to America before the immigration described in 1 Nephi. 1 Nephi through Omni are written in first-person narrative, as are Mormon and Moroni. The remainder of the Book of Mormon is written in third-person historical narrative, said to be compiled and abridged by Mormon (with Moroni abridging the Book of Ether).
Most modern editions of the book have been divided into chapters and verses. Most editions of the book also contain supplementary material, including the Testimony of Three Witnesses and the Testimony of Eight Witnesses, which are statements by men who said they saw the golden plates with Joseph Smith and could verify their existence.

The books from 1 Nephi to Omni are described as being from "the small plates of Nephi".[38] This account begins in ancient Jerusalem around 600 BC. It tells the story of a man named Lehi, his family, and several others as they are led by God from Jerusalem shortly before the fall of that city to the Babylonians in 586 BC. The book describes their journey across the Arabian peninsula, and then to the promised land, the Americas, by ship.[39] These books recount the group's dealings from approximately 600 BC to about 130 BC, during which time the community grew and split into two main groups, which are called the Nephites and the Lamanites, that war with each other.
Following this section is the Words of Mormon. This small book, said to be written in AD 385 by Mormon, is a short introduction to the books of Mosiah, Alma, Helaman, 3 Nephi, and 4 Nephi[40]. These books are described as being abridged from a large quantity of existing records called "the large plates of Nephi" that detailed the nation's history from the time of Omni to Mormon's own life. The book of 3 Nephi is of particular importance within the Book of Mormon because it contains an account of a visit by Jesus from heaven to the Americas sometime after his resurrection and ascension. The text says that during this American visit, he repeated much of the same doctrine and instruction given in the Gospels of the Bible and he established an enlightened, peaceful society which endured for several generations, but which eventually broke into warring factions again.
The book of Mormon is an account of the events during Mormon's life. Mormon is said to have received the charge of taking care of the records that had been hidden, once he was old enough. The book includes an account of the wars, Mormon's leading of portions of the Nephite army, and his retrieving and caring for the records. Mormon eventually is killed, after he hands down the records to his son Moroni.
According to the text, Moroni then makes an abridgment (called Ether) of a record from a previous people called the Jaredites[40]. The account describes a group of families led from the Tower of Babel [41] to the Americas, headed by a man named Jared and his brother. The Jaredite civilization is presented as existing on the American continent long before Lehi's family arrived in 600 BC, beginning about 2500 BC,[42] and it was much larger and more developed. The dating in the text is only an approximation.
The book of Moroni then details the final destruction of the Nephites and the idolatrous state of the remaining society[43]. It mentions a few spiritual insights and some important doctrinal teachings[44], then closes with Moroni's testimony and an invitation to pray to God for a confirmation of the truthfulness of the account[45].

The Book of Mormon contains doctrinal and philosophical teachings on a wide range of topics, from basic themes of Christianity and Judaism to political and ideological teachings.

Stated on the title page, the Book of Mormon's central purpose is for the "convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations."[46]
The book describes Jesus, prior to his birth, as a spirit "without flesh and blood", although with a spirit "body" that looked similar to that as Jesus would appear during his physical life.[47] Jesus is described as "the Father and the Son".[48] He is said to be:
Other parts of the book portray the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost as "one"[50] Beliefs among the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement encompass nontrinitarianism in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to Trinitarianism, particularly among the Community of Christ. See Godhead (Latter Day Saints).
In furtherance of its theme of reconciling Jews and gentiles to Jesus, the book describes a variety of visions or visitations to some of the early inhabitants in the Americas involving Jesus. Most notable among these is a described visit of the Jesus to the a group of early inhabitants shortly after his resurrection.[51] Many of the book's narrators described other visions of Jesus, including one by a narrator who, according to the book, lived thousands of years before Jesus, but who saw the "body" of Jesus' spirit thousands of years prior to his birth.[52] In another vision, according to the book, a different narrator described a vision of the birth, ministry, and death of Jesus,[53], including a prophecy of Jesus' name,[54] said to have taken place nearly 600 years prior to Jesus' birth,[55]
In the narrative, at the time of King Benjamin (date about 130 BC), the Nephite believers were called "the children of Christ".[56] At another place, the faithful members of the church at the time of Captain Moroni (73 B.C.) were called "Christians" by their enemies, because of their belief in Jesus Christ.[57] The book also states that for nearly 200 years after Jesus' appearance at the temple in the Americas,[58] the land was filled with peace and prosperity because of the people's obedience to his commandments.[59] Later, the prophet Mormon worked to convince the faithless people of his time (360 A.D.) of Christ. The prophet Moroni is said to have buried the plates with faith in Christ.[60] Many other prophets in the book also wrote of the reality of the Messiah.
Jesus spoke to the Jews in Jerusalem of “other sheep” who would hear his voice,[61] which the Book of Mormon claims meant that the Nephites and other remnants of the lost tribes of Israel throughout the world were to be visited by Jesus after his resurrection.[62]

On most religious issues, Book of Mormon doctrines are similar to those found in the Bible and among other Christian denominations. Among its distinctive theological contributions are the following:

The book delves into political and ideological themes, but places them within a Christian or Jewish context. Among these themes are American exceptionalism. According to the book, the Americas are portrayed as a "land of promise", the world's most exceptional land[66] of the time. The book states that any righteous society possessing the land would be protected, whereas if they became wicked they would be destroyed and replaced with a more righteous civilization.[67]
On the issue of war and violence, the book teaches that war is justified for people to "defend themselves against their enemies," however they were never to "give an offense," or to "raise their sword...except it were to preserve their lives."[68] The book praises the faith of a group of former warriors who took an oath of complete pacifism, refusing to take arms even to defend themselves and their people.[69] However, 2,000 of their descendants, who had not taken the oath of their parents to not take up arms against their enemies, chose to go to battle against the Lamanites, and it states that in the battle the 2,000 men were protected by God, and none of them died.[70]
The book points out monarchy as an ideal form of government, but only when the monarch is righteous.[71][72] However, the book warns of the evil that occurs when the king is wicked and therefore suggests that it is not generally good to have a king.[73] The book further records the decision of the people to no longer be ruled by kings,[74] instead they chose a form of democracy led by elected judges.[75] When citizens referred to as "king-men" attempted to overthrow a democratically-elected government and establish an unrighteous king, the book praises a military commander who executed pro-monarchy citizens who had vowed to destroy the church of God and were unwilling to defend their country from hostile invading forces.[76] The book also speaks favorably of a particular instance of what appears to be a peaceful Christ-centered theocracy, which lasted approximately 194 years before contentions began again.[77]
The book supports notions of economic justice, achieved through voluntary donation of "substance, every man according to that which he had, to the poor"[78] and in one case, all the citizens held their property in common[79] Concern for the poor is portrayed as leading to collective wealth[80] However, when individuals within a society began to disdain and ignore the poor, to "wea
