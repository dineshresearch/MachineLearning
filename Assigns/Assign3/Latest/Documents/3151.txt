Lupe Fiasco
Wasalu Muhammad Jaco (born February 17, 1982),[1] better known by his stage name Lupe Fiasco, is a Grammy-winning American hip-hop artist. He rose to fame in 2006 following the success of his critically acclaimed debut album, Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor. Prominent hip hop mogul Jay-Z describes him as a "breath of fresh air" in a new hip hop world characterized by mainstream pop and glamor, a sharp contrast with the widespread lyricism-focused rap of the 1990s, and critics have called him the "Hip-Hop Generation's Next Vanguard."[2]


Jaco was raised a Muslim in an African American [3] family living on the West side of Chicago,[4] and is the fifth child of nine brothers and sisters. His father was an engineer, a prolific African drummer, karate teacher and owner of karate schools and army surplus stores.[5] His mother was a gourmet chef. He went to high school at Thornton Township High School in Harvey, Illinois.[6] He was initially put off by the vulgarity and violent imagery of his father's N.W.A. records. He started rapping when he was in the eighth grade, and [4] upon hearing Nas' 1996 album, It Was Written, began to pursue hip hop music.[3][5]
Growing up, Jaco was given the nickname "Lu", the last part of his first name, by his mother. "Lupe" is an extension of this nickname, which he borrowed from a friend from high school. "Fiasco," he says, "came from the Firm album. They had the song, 'Firm Fiasco'. I just liked the way it looked on paper."[6]
By 19, Lupe Fiasco was in a group called Da Pak. They signed to Epic Records and released one single before splitting up.[7] Fiasco later signed a solo deal with Arista Records, but was dropped when president and CEO L.A. Reid was fired.[7] During this time, he had guest appearances on singles on Tha' Rayne's "Kiss Me" and "Didn't You Know" and also K Foxx's 2004 "This Life". He also released the song "Coulda Been" on a compilation of MTV's Advance Warning.[8] He began releasing many mixtapes, developing a fan base via the internet.

Lupe had gained a large underground following with the release of a series of critically acclaimed mixtapes, prominently Lupe's own Fahrenheit 1/15 Part I: The Truth Is Among Us, Fahrenheit 1/15 Part II: Revenge of the Nerds, and Fahrenheit 1/15 Part III: A Rhyming Ape. In 2005, Lupe was featured on two tracks on Mike Shinoda's solo mixtape titled Fort Minor: We Major and was even an active member on the official Fort Minor message boards.[9] During this time, rapper and mogul Jay-Z heard Lupe and assisted him in the production of what would become his debut album Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor.[10]
In 2005, Lupe appeared on the Kanye West track "Touch the Sky" from West's Late Registration. Soon after, he released his first single "Kick, Push", a song heavily influenced by skateboarding. As his popularity slowly increased, so did anticipation for his upcoming album Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor. The album was officially released on September 19, 2006. The album featured production from Jay-Z, Kanye West, Mike Shinoda, The Neptunes, Prolyfic, and more. Singles from the album were "Kick, Push," "I Gotcha" and "Daydreamin'" featuring Jill Scott. The critically lauded album was later nominated for three Grammy Awards including Best Rap Album. In the same year, he was voted by GQ as the "Breakout Man of the Year."[11]

In 2007, Lupe announced his second album, Lupe Fiasco's The Cool, a concept album that expands on the story of the track of the same name on his first album. It was released on December 18, 2007 in United States. The first single and video from the album, "Superstar", featuring Matthew Santos, was released the first week of November 2007. Baseball's Troy Tulowitzki, Ryan Zimmerman, Gerald Laird and all-star Ryan Braun have used "Superstar" as their at-bat song.[12] The song has also been featured in HBO's Hard Knocks TV show.
Also in 2007, it was revealed that Fiasco, Kanye West and Pharrell Williams had formed a group known as Child Rebel Soldier.[13][14] Child Rebel Soldier, also known as "CRS", released their first album naming it Rebel Music. Rebel Music features samples of beats from the members albums such as Kanye West's: Graduation, Lupe Fiasco's: The Cool, and Pharrell Williams Hip-Hop/Punk Rock group N.E.R.D.. Also, "Rebel Music" includes remixes from those albums and fetures other Hip-Hop artists such as Jay-Z, Common, and N.E.R.D.. [15] CRS released one single from their album titled "US Placers", featuring a Thom Yorke sample.
Songs from Lupe Fiasco's The Cool are featured in the movie Street Kings. The songs "Put You on Game" and "Little Weapon" both appear in the latest trailer.
In an interview with The Village Voice, Fiasco revealed that he was writing a novel about a window washer[16] aptly titled Reflections of a Window Washer.
In 2008, Lupe and his band 1500 or Nothin joined Kanye's Glow in the Dark Tour, which also features Rihanna and N.E.R.D. The tour stopped in several cities, including his hometown of Chicago. He's been made #7 as the Hottest MCs in the Game of 2008 by MTV.[17]
Lupe announced that he was remixing The Cool with French electro house act Justice.[18]
Lupe Fiasco's "Superstar" has been included in the video game Lips.[19]

Fiasco announced at a Chicago concert late in 2008 that his next and most likely final album will be a three disk album and that the first disc "Everywhere" would come out in June 2009. The trio was going to be named LupE.N.D.[20] On January 30, 2009, Lupe Fiasco originally announced that LupE.N.D. will be postponed indefinitely. Instead, he would release three albums; The Great American Rap Album in June 2009, two following albums in December 2009 and June 2010, with LupE.N.D. following afterward.[21] However, it was announced Fiasco that his next album would instead be titled, We Are Lasers.[22]

Fiasco is the co-founder and vice-president of 1st & 15th Entertainment, a record label under Atlantic[5]. Fiasco serves as the current CEO. In January 2006, Lupe signed with major footwear and apparel corporation Reebok becoming part of the "O.G" marketing campaign, where rap artists such as Lil Wayne and Mike Jones designed their own personal colorway of the Reebok "O.G" model.[23]
