Paris (pronounced /Ààp√¶r…™s/ in English;  [pa Åi] (help¬∑info) in French) is the capital of France and the country's largest city. It is situated on the river Seine, in northern France, at the heart of the √éle-de-France region (also known as the "Paris Region"; French: R√©gion parisienne). The city of Paris, within its limits largely unchanged since 1860, has an estimated population of 2,167,994 (January 2006),[2] but the Paris aire urbaine (or metropolitan area) has a population of nearly 12†million,[3] and is one of the most populated metropolitan areas in Europe.[4]
An important settlement for more than two millennia, Paris is today one of the world's leading business and cultural centres, and its influence in politics, education, entertainment, media, fashion, science and the arts all contribute to its status as one of the world's major global cities.[5] According to 2005 estimates, the Paris urban area is Europe's biggest city economy,[6] and is fifth in the world's list of cities by GDP.[7]
Paris and the Paris Region, with ‚Ç¨533.6 billion (US$731.3†billion) in 2007, produces more than a quarter of the gross domestic product (GDP) of France.[8] The Paris Region hosts 37 of the Fortune Global 500 companies[9] in several business districts, notably La D√©fense, the largest purpose-built business district in Europe.[10] Paris also hosts many international organizations such as UNESCO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and the informal Paris Club.
Paris is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, with 45†million tourists every year in the Paris Region, 60% of whom are foreign visitors.[11] There are numerous iconic landmarks among its many attractions, along with world-famous institutions and popular parks.

The name Paris derives from that of its inhabitants, the Gaulish tribe known as the Parisii. The city was called Lutetia (/lutetja/) (more fully, Lutetia Parisiorum, "Lutetia of the Parisii"), during the first- to sixth-century Roman occupation, but during the reign of Julian the Apostate (360‚Äì363) the city was renamed Paris.[12]
Others consider that the name of the Parisii tribe comes from the Celtic Gallic word parisio meaning "the working people" or "the craftsmen."[13] Since the early 20th century, Paris has been known as Paname ([panam]) in French slang (Moi j'suis d'Paname, i.e. "I'm from Paname"), a slang name that has been regaining favor with young people in recent years.
Paris has many nicknames, but its most famous is "La Ville-Lumi√®re" (literally, "The Light City"; although most often translated as "The City of Lights" or as "The City of Light"),[14] a name it owes both to its fame as a centre of education and ideas and its early adoption of street lighting.
Paris' inhabitants are known in English as "Parisians" (/p…ôÀàr…™z…™…ônz/ or /p…ôÀàriÀê í…ônz/) and in French as Parisiens ( [pa Åizj…õÃÉ] (help¬∑info)). Parisians are often pejoratively called Parigots ( [pa Åigo] (help¬∑info)) by those living outside the Paris region, but the term may be considered endearing by Parisians themselves.


The earliest archaeological signs of permanent habitation in the Paris area date from around 4200 BC.[15] The Parisii, a sub-tribe of the Celtic Senones, known as boatsmen and traders[citation needed], inhabited the area near the river Seine from around 250 BC[citation needed]. The Romans conquered the Paris basin in 52 BC,[15] with a permanent settlement by the end of the same century on the Left Bank Sainte Genevi√®ve Hill and the √éle de la Cit√©. The Gallo-Roman town was originally called Lutetia, but later Gallicised to Lut√®ce. It expanded greatly over the following centuries, becoming a prosperous city with a forum, palaces, baths, temples, theatres, and an amphitheatre.[16] The collapse of the Roman empire and the fifth-century Germanic invasions sent the city into a period of decline. By 400 AD, Lut√®ce, by then largely abandoned by its inhabitants, was little more than a garrison town entrenched into the hastily fortified central island.[15] The city reclaimed its original appellation of "Paris" towards the end of the Roman occupation. The Frankish king Clovis I established Paris as his capital in 508.

Paris lost its position as seat of the French realm during occupation of the English-allied Burgundians during the Hundred Years' War, but regained its title when Charles VII of France reclaimed the city in 1437. Although Paris was capital once again, the Crown preferred to remain in the Loire Valley.[17] In 1528, King Francois I shifted the center of power in France from the Loire back to the capital of Paris. During the French Wars of Religion, Paris was a stronghold of the Catholic party. In August 1572, under the reign of Charles IX, while many noble Protestants were in Paris on the occasion of the marriage of Henry of Navarre, the future Henry IV, to Marguerite de Valois, sister of Charles IX, the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre occurred; begun on 24 August, it lasted several days and spread throughout the country.[18][19] During the Fronde, Parisians rose in rebellion and the royal family fled the city (1648). King Louis XIV then moved the royal court permanently to Versailles in 1682. A century later, Paris was the centre stage for the French Revolution, with the Storming of the Bastille in 1789 and the overthrow of the monarchy in 1792.[20] On 31 March 1814, Paris fell to the Russians‚Äîthe first time in 400 years that the city had been conquered by a foreign power.[21] The Cossack and Kalmyk cavalry units in Russian service entered city.

Parisians revolted against the monarchy during the July Revolution of 1830. King Charles X was forced to abdicate the throne. The "February Revolution" of 1848 ended the constitutional monarchy of Louis-Philippe, and led to the creation of the Second Republic.
The Industrial Revolution, the French Second Empire, and the Belle √âpoque brought Paris the greatest development in its history. From the 1840s, rail transport allowed an unprecedented flow of migrants into Paris attracted by employment in the new industries in the suburbs. The city underwent a massive renovation under Napoleon III and his pr√©fet Haussmann, who levelled entire districts of narrow, winding medieval streets to create the network of wide avenues and neo-classical fa√ßades of modern Paris. This programme of "Haussmannization" was designed to make the city both more beautiful and more sanitary for its inhabitants, although it did have the added benefit that, in case of future revolts or revolutions, cavalry charges and rifle fire could be used to deal with the insurrection, while the rebel tactic of barricading so often used during the Revolution would become obsolete.[22]
Cholera epidemics in 1832 and 1849 affected the population of Paris; the 1832 epidemic alone claimed 20,000 of the then-population of 650,000.[23] Paris also suffered greatly from the siege, which ended the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì1871): in the chaos caused by the fall of Napoleon III's government, the newly-established Commune of Paris sent many of Paris' administrative centres (and city archives) up in flames while 20,000 Parisians were killed by fighting between Commune and government forces in what became known as the semaine sanglante (Bloody Week).[24]
Paris recovered rapidly from these events to host the famous Universal Expositions of the late nineteenth century.[25] The Eiffel Tower was built for the French Revolution centennial 1889 Universal Exposition, as a "temporary" display of architectural engineering prowess but remained the world's tallest building until 1930, and is the city's best-known landmark, while the 1900 Universal Exposition saw the opening of the first Paris M√©tro line. Paris' World's Fairs also consolidated its position in the tourist industry and as an attractive setting for international technology and trade shows.[25]

During World War I, Paris was at the forefront of the war effort, having been spared a German invasion by the French and British victory at the First Battle of the Marne in 1914. In 1918-1919, it was the scene of Allied victory parades and peace negotiations. In the inter-war period Paris was famed for its cultural and artistic communities and its nightlife. The city became a gathering place of artists from around the world, from exiled Russian composer Stravinsky and Spanish painters Picasso and Dal√≠ to American writer Hemingway.[26]
On 14 June 1940, five weeks after the start of the Battle of France, Paris fell to German occupation forces, who remained there until the city was
