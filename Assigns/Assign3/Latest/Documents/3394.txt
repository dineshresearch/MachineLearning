Jacque Fresco
Jacque Fresco is an industrial designer and social engineer, author, lecturer, futurist, inventor, a pioneer in the field of human factors engineering, based in Venus, Florida, USA, and the creator of the Venus Project.[1][2][3] Fresco has worked as both designer and inventor in a wide range of fields spanning from biomedical innovations to totally integrated social systems. He believes his ideas would maximally benefit the greatest number of people and he states some of his ideas stem from his formative years during the Great Depression.[4]
In the mid-1970s, he started The Venus Project and the non-profit organization Future by Design together with Roxanne Meadows, that reflects the culmination of Frescoâ€™s life work. To this day he writes and lectures extensively on subjects ranging from the holistic design of sustainable cities, energy efficiency, natural resource management and advanced automation, focusing on the benefits it will bring to society.[2][5]


Born on March 13, 1916, Jacque Fresco started his professional career as design consultant for Rotor Craft Helicopter Company. He served in the Army Design and Development Unit at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, U.S. and worked for the Raymond De-Icer Corporation based in Los Angeles, California, U.S., as a research engineer.[5][4]
He worked for many companies and in many fields such as technical consultant and technical advisor to the Motion Picture Industry, industrial design instructor at the Art Center School in Hollywood, California. In Los Angeles, he was colleague and work associate of psychologist Donald Powell Wilson.[5][4]
In 1942, Fresco started the Revell Plastics Company (now Revell-Monogram) with Lou Glaser, although he later left to pursue his other ideas, working variously in aerospace research and development, architecture, efficient automobile design, bare-eye 3D cinematic projection methods and medical equipment design where he developed a three dimensional X-ray unit amongst other things.[5][4]

The Venus Project was started around 1975[2] by self-described futurist and "social designer", Jacque Fresco[1][6] and by former portrait artist, Roxanne Meadows[2] in Venus, Florida, USA. It is a 21-acre (85,000 m2) property populated with various domed buildings of his design along with his assistant, Roxanne Meadows, where they work on books and film to demonstrate their concepts and ideas.[4] The Venus Project was incorporated in 1995,[7][8]
The project was founded on the idea that poverty is caused by the stifling of progress in technology, which itself is caused by the present world's profit-driven economic system.[9] The progression of technology, if it were carried on independent of its profitability, Fresco theorizes, would make more resources available to more people. This new-found abundance of resources would reduce the human tendency toward independence, corruption and greed, and instead make people more likely to help each other.[10][6][11] Fundamental to the project is the elimination of the current money-based economy in favor of what Fresco calls a resource-based economy.[12]
According to a 2008 interview with Fresco and Meadows, Fresco's lack of credentials has made it difficult for him to gain influence in academic circles.[2] He adds that when universities do invite him to speak, they often don't give him enough time to explain his views.[2]
The Venus Project is featured prominently in the 2008 documentary film Zeitgeist: Addendum, as a possible solution to the global problems alleged in the film.[6] The film premiered at the 5th Annual Artivist Film Festival in Los Angeles, California on October 2, 2008, winning their highest award, and it was released online for free on Google video[13] on October 4, 2008.[14]

A major theme of Fresco's is the concept of a resource-based economy that replaces the need for the scarcity-oriented monetary economy we have now. Fresco argues that the world is rich in natural resources and energy and that â€”with modern technology and judicious efficiencyâ€” the needs of the global population can be met with abundance, while at the same time removing the current limitations of what is deemed possible due to notions of economic viability.
He gives this example to help explain the idea:
Fresco states that for this to work, all of the Earth's resources must be held as the common heritage of all people and not just a select few; and the practice of rationing resources through monetary methods is irrelevant and counter-productive to our survival.
