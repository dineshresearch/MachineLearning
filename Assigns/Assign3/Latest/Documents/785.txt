A Clockwork Orange (film)
A Clockwork Orange is a 1971 satirical science fiction film adaptation of a 1962 novel of the same name, written by Anthony Burgess. The adaptation was produced, co-written, and directed by Stanley Kubrick. It stars Malcolm McDowell as the charismatic and psychopathic delinquent Alex DeLarge whose pleasures are classical music (especially Beethoven), rape, and ultra-violence. He is the leader of a small gang of thugs (Pete, Georgie and Dim), whom he calls his "droogs" (from the Russian word Ð´Ñ€ÑƒÐ³ meaning "friend" or "buddy"). Alex narrates most of the film in "Nadsat", a fractured contemporary adolescent argot comprising Slavic (especially Russian), English, and Cockney rhyming slang. A Clockwork Orange features disturbing, violent imagery to facilitate social commentary on psychiatry, youth gangs, and other topics in a futuristic dystopian Britain.
The film features a soundtrack comprising mostly classical music selections and Moog synthesizer compositions by Wendy (then Walter) Carlos. One notable exception is "Singing in the Rain," which was chosen because it was a song actor Malcolm McDowell knew all the words to.[1]

Narrated by Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell), the film opens on Alex and his droogs parting of narcotic-spiked milk at the Korova Milk Bar prior to an evening of "the old ultra-violence". They proceed to beat up an elderly vagrant under a motorway and get in a brawl with a rival gang led by Billyboy[2] (Richard Connaught). Upon hearing the sounds of police sirens, the gang flees, stealing a car and driving into the countryside. They then gain entry to the home of Mr. Alexander, a writer, under false pretenses and assault him while sexually assaulting his wife, all while Alex sings "Singin' in the Rain". When they return to the milk bar, Alex chides Dim (Warren Clarke), one of his droogs, when he criticizes the work of Beethoven, an artist Alex admires.
The next day, after skipping school and ignoring the concerns of Mr. Deltoid (Aubrey Morris), a social worker, Alex regroups with his droogs who insist on running the gang in a different manner that entails more ambitious crimes. As they walk by a canal, Alex turns and attacks his droogs to re-establish his leadership. That night, the gang attempts to burgle the home of a "cat lady" (Miriam Karlin) that runs a health farm. In the process, she gets into a fight with Alex, and Alex mortally wounds her with a phallus-shaped statue. As he attempts to flee as the police arrive, his droogs smash a glass bottle across his face, crippling him and leave him to be arrested. During his interrogation, Alex is told by Mr. Deltoid that he is now a murderer as the cat lady died from her injuries.
In prison, Alex becomes friends with the chaplain and takes a keen interest in the Bible, but primarily on the more violent characters. When the Minister of the Interior (Anthony Sharp) arrives at the prison looking for volunteers for the Ludovico technique, an experimental aversion therapy for rehabilitating criminals, Alex eagerly steps forward. At the Ludovico facility, Alex is placed in a straitjacket and forced to watch films containing scenes of extreme violence while being given drugs to induce reactions of revulsion. The films include one of real scenes in Nazi Germany, which includes a soundtrack of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Alex realizes this will likely condition him against Beethoven's music and makes an agonized though unsuccessful attempt to have the treatment end prematurely before the conditioning sets in. After the treatment is finished, Alex's reformed behavior is demonstrated for the audience: he is unable to respond back to an actor (John Clive) shouting insults and picking a fight with him, nor is he able to think of sexual thoughts when presented with a naked woman. The Minister declares Alex to be cured, but the chaplain asserts that Alex no longer has any free will.
Alex is let free from prison two years after his sentencing. He finds his parents have rented out his room, leaving him on his own. Alex comes across the vagrant he had assaulted before the treatment, who calls in his friends and beat up Alex. Two policemen arrive to break up the fight, but Alex discovers them to be his former droogs, and the two beat him up and drag him out to the countryside as revenge. Battered and bruised, Alex manages to escape and wanders to the home of Mr. Alexander, who takes Alex in, aware that he had undergone the Ludovico treatment but does not recognize him from two years prior. Mr. Alexander tends to Alex's wounds, but when Alex sings "Singin' in the Rain" while taking a bath, the memories of his assault return. Mr. Alexander locks Alex in the upper floor of his home and plays Beethoven's Ninth Symphony at full volume through a powerful stereo on the floor below, knowing that the Ludovico treatment will cause immense pain to Alex. Alex frees himself from the torture by throwing himself out of the room's window.
Alex recovers consciousness to find himself in traction, with dreams about doctors messing around inside his head. Through a series of psychological tests, Alex finds he no longer has a revulsion to violence. The Minister of the Interior comes to Alex and apologizes for subjecting him to the treatment, and informs him that Mr. Alexander has been arrested. The Minister then offers Alex an important government job and as a show of goodwill, has a stereo wheeled to his bedside playing Beethoven's Ninth. Realising that he has no adverse reaction to the music but instead images of sexual pleasures, Alex states "I was cured all right!"



One of the film's central moral questions â€“ as well as in many of Burgess's other books â€“ is the definition of "goodness". After aversion therapy, Alex behaves like a good member of society, but not by choice; his "goodness" is involuntary and mechanical, like that of the titular clockwork orange. In prison, the chaplain criticises the Ludovico Technique, saying that true goodness must come from within. Another theme is the abuse of one's liberties â€“ both by Alex and by those using him for their various ends. The film is also critical of both parties using Alex as a tool to those ends: Frank Alexander, writer and victim of Alex and the droogs, not only wants revenge over Alex, but sees him as a means to definitively turn the people against the government and its new regime â€“ Mr. Alexander is afraid of this new government. Speaking on the phone, he says:
â€¦Recruiting brutal young roughs into the police; proposing debilitating and will-sapping techniques of conditioning. Oh, we've seen it all before in other countries; the thin end of the wedge! Before we know where we are, we shall have the full apparatus of totalitarianism.
On the other side, the Minister of the Interior, representing the government, puts Mr. Alexander away, using the excuse of him being a danger to Alex. Whether he has been harmed or not remains unclear, but from what the Minister tells Alex, it is obvious that the author has been denied his ability to write and, more importantly, to produce "subversive" material, critical of the current government and prone to cause unrest.

Another central theme is outrage against behavioural psychology (popular throughout the 1940s through the 1960s), as propounded by psychologists John B. Watson and B. F. Skinner. Burgess disapproved of behaviourism, calling Skinner's most popular book, Beyond Freedom and Dignity, "one of the most dangerous books ever written".[3] Although Watson conceded behaviourism's limitations, Skinner argued that behaviour modification (learning techniques of systematic reward and punishment) is the key to an ideal society (see Walden Two). Dr. Ludovico's technique, which is highly reminiscent of the notorious Project MKULTRA, is the form of behaviour modification the scientists applied to Alex to condition associating violent acts with a sensation of severe physical illness, thereby preventing him from being violent. This film embodies a mistrust of behaviourism, especially the perceived dehumanisation and lack of choice associated with behaviour modification methods.
Belgian cinema writer Anthony Bochon points out the criminological question underlying the Ludovico treatment. He describes the quality of the film description of the Ludovico treatment as "a problem of integrating the bad, the criminal, who is rejecting human dignity, into Humanity itself. Kubrick didn't make an apology of some fascist practices but simply brought his vision of the future of our society and how violence is fed by our society"[4].

During the filming of the Ludovico scene, Malcolm McDowell scratched a cornea and was temporarily blinded. The doctor standing next to him in the scene dropping saline solution into Alex's forced-open eyes was not just there for filming purposes, but was a real doctor needed to prevent McDowell's eyes from drying. McDowell also suffered cracked ribs during filming of the humiliation stage show and nearly drowned when his breathing apparatus failed while being held underwater in the trough scene.
When Alex jumps out of the window to try to end his torment, the viewer sees the ground coming toward the camera until they collide. This effect was achieved by dropping a portable camera from two or three stories up, lens pointing downward, thus presenting a realistic sense of what such a fall could be like (although the way Alex (either McDowell or a stuntman) jumped, he actually would have landed on his back, presumably into a net). Reportedly the camera sustained lens damage but it was otherwise still functional.

This film adaptation of Anthony Burgess' book happened almost by accident. The director Stanley Kubrick had been given a copy which he initially put to one side. On the rebound from the cancellation of the production of Napoleon he happened again on the copy and it made an immediate impact on him. Kubrick said of his enthusiasm for the project "I was excited by everything about it, the plot, the ideas, the characters and of course the language...The story functions, of course, on several levels, political, sociological, philosophical and, what's most important, on a dreamlike psychological-symbolic level". When Kubrick wrote the screenplay he made a point of sticking very closely to the original text, "I think whatever Burgess had to say about the story was said in the book but I did invent a few useful narrative ideas and reshape some of the scenes."

Anthony Burgess had mixed feelings about the film adaptation of his novel. Publicly, he said he loved Malcolm McDowell and Michael Bates, and the film's use of music; he praised the film as "brilliant," even as a film so brilliant that it could be dangerous. His initial reaction to the film was very enthusiastic, insisting that the only thing that bothered him was the removal of the story's last chapter, for which he blamed his American publisher and not Kubrick.
According to his autobiography, Burgess got along quite well with Kubrick. Both men held similar philosophic and political views; both were very interested in literature, cinema, music, and Napoleon Bonaparte (Burgess dedicated his book Napoleon Symphony to Kubrick). However their relationship was soured when Kubrick left it to Burgess to defend the film from accusations of glorifying violence. As a (lapsed) Catholic, Burgess tried many times to explain the story's Christian moral points to outraged Christian organisations who felt it a Satanic social influence; to defend it against journalistic accusations that it supported "fascist" dogma; and Burgess even received awards for Kubrick.
Burgess was deeply hurt, feeling Kubrick had used him as a film publicity pawn. Malcolm McDowell, who did a publicity tour with Burgess, shared his feelings, and at times said harsh things about Kubrick. Burgess and McDowell cited as evidence of Kubrick's uncontrolled ego that only Kubrick's name appears in the authorial opening credits. Burgess spoofed Kubrick's image in later works: the musical version of A Clockwork Orange, featuring a character resembling Kubrick who is beaten early in the work; The Clockwork Testament, wherein the fictional poet FX Enderby is attacked for supposedly glorifying violence in a film adaptation; and Burgess's novel Earthly Powers, which features a crafty director named Sidney Labrick.

The first dramatisation of A Clockwork Orange (excerpted from the story's first three chapters only) was by the BBC, for part of the programme Tonight, broadcast shortly after the novel's original publication in 1962. No recording of this dramatisation has survived. Six years before Stanley Kubrick's film version, Andy Warhol produced a low-budget version in 1965, titled Vinyl. Reportedly, only two scenes are recognisable: "Victor" (a renamed Alex) wreaking havoc, and undergoing the Ludovico Treatment.

Director Stanley Kubrick was a notorious perfectionist, and so he demanded many takes during the making of his films. In the words of actor Malcolm McDowell, however, he usually got it right, so Kubrick did not have to do too many takes. Despite his perfectionism Kubrick was able to complete filming between September 1970 and its wrap on 20 April 1971, making it his fastest produced film. Kubrick wanted to give the film a dream-like, fantasy quality, and filmed many scenes with fisheye lenses. He also used fast and slow motion after being influenced by certain scenes in Toshio Matsumoto's Funeral Parade of Roses.

A Clockwork Orange was shot almost entirely on location in and around London with comparatively little of the film filmed in a studio.

The film was positively received and was nominated for important awards including four Oscar nominations (see below). The film receives a 90% "fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture (it lost to The French Connection) and reinvigorated sales for recordings of Beethoven's "Ninth Symphony".
Though hailed by many critics, the film had some notable detractors. Roger Ebert, for example, gave the film two stars and calling it an "ideological mess", as well as being "talky and boring".[6] In her New Yorker review, titled "Stanley Strangelove" and included in the collection Deeper into Movies, Pauline Kael called the film pornographic because of the way it dehumanised Alex's victims while highlighting the protagonist's suffering. She also noted that the film's Alex no longer enjoyed running over small animals or raping underaged girls, and argued that some violent scenesâ€”such as the extended sequence in which Billyboy's gang strips a very buxom young woman they intend to rapeâ€”were offered for titillation. John Simon (in a piece collected in his book Reverse Angle) noted that most of the book's most ambitious effects were based on language and the alienating effect of the narrator's Nadsat slang, making it a poor choice for a film. Echoing some of Kael's criticisms about the depiction of Alex's victims, Simon noted that the writer, who is young and likeable in the book, was played by Patrick Magee, "a very quirky and middle-aged actor who specialises in being repellent." on top of which, Simon complained, "Kubrick over-directs the basically excessive Magee until his eyes erupt like missiles from their silos and his face turns every shade of a Technicolor sunset."

It also caused considerable controversy (see below) and was withdrawn from release in the UK. By the time of its re-release in the year 2000, it had already gained a reputation as a cult classic. It was recently placed at number 21 on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills and number 46 on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies, though in the second listing it ranked in 70th place. Alex De Large was placed at number 12 in the villain section of the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains list. In 2008, the film was placed as the 4th greatest Science-Fiction movie to date, in AFI's 10 Top 10.

The film was rated X on its original release in the United States. Later, Kubrick voluntarily replaced roughly 30 seconds of footage from two scenes with less bawdy action for a 1973 R-rated re-release. Current DVDs present the original X-rated form, and only some of the early 80s VHS editions are in the R-rated form.[7]
The film was rated C (for "condemned") by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Office for Film and Broadcasting because of its explicit sexual and violent content; such a rating conceptually forbade Catholics from seeing the film. The "condemned" rating was abolished in 1982, and since then films deemed by the conference to have unacceptable levels of sex and/or violence have been rated O, meaning "morally offensive".

In the United Kingdom, the sexual violence in the film was considered extreme. Furthermore, it was claimed that the film had inspired copycat behaviour. In March 1972, a prosecutor at a trial of a 14-year-old boy accused of the manslaughter of one of his classmates referred to A Clockwork Orange, telling the judge that the case had a macabre relevance to the film.[8]
The attacker, a boy aged 16 from Bletchley, pleaded guilty after telling police that his friends had told him of the film "and the beating up of an old boy like this one"; defence counsel told the trial "the link between this crime and sensational literature, particularly A Clockwork Orange, is established beyond reasonable doubt".[9] The press also blamed the influence of the film for a rape in which the attackers sang "Singin' in the Rain". Kubrick subsequently requested that Warner Brothers withdraw the film from UK distribution.
At the time, it was widely believed that the copycat attacks were what led Kubrick to withdraw the film from distribution in the United Kingdom. However, in a television documentary made after Kubrick's death, his widow Christiane confirmed rumours that Kubrick had withdrawn A Clockwork Orange on police advice after threats were made against Kubrick and his family (the source of the threats was not discussed). That Warner Bros. acceded to Kubrick's request to withdraw the film is an indication of the remarkable relationship Kubrick had with the studio, particularly the executive Terry Semel.
The ban was vigorously pursued during Kubrick's lifetime. One art house cinema that defied the ban in 1993, and was sued and lost, was the Scala cinema at Kings Cross, London, on the same premises as
