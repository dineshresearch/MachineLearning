List of Biblical names
This is a list of names from the Bible, mainly taken from the 19th century public domain resource:
Each name is given with its meaning. Please note that "names" refers to any noun, which may be: people, places, cities, countries, angels, gods, mountains, etc. Meanings of the names are not always definite or clear, but a possible meaning has been provided in every case.
Note: The actual name of the Hebrew God (Jehovah/Yahweh) has been entered instead of "LORD". The name of the Hebrew God is usually found in Hebrew names as "iah" or "jah" in the anglicized form. The substitution of the word "lord" is inaccurate as the Hebrew word for lord is "adon",or "adonim" "adonai" and "god" is "el", "elim", or "elohim". See â€ŽTetragrammaton. And Hebrew had no "J" so all "J" names have been anglicized, so that "Y" has been changed to "J" for English speakers.
