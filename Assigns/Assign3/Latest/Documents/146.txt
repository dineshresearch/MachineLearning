Goatse.cx
Goatse.cx (pronounced either "/goʊtsi: dɒt si: ɛks/" or "/goʊt sɛks/") was an Internet shock site. Its front page featured a picture, hello.jpg, showing a naked man stretching his anus to a large size with both hands, with the inside of his rectum clearly visible. Below his gaping anus, his dangling penis and scrotum are visible, as well as a ring on the ring finger of his left hand.[1]
The image, originally named gap3.jpg, originates from a set of forty images called gap.zip. In those images, the man used dildos and butt plugs to stretch his anus. The images were located by Stile Project and are also available from the "Contrib" section of the goatse.cx website.[2]

On January 14, 2004, the domain goatse.cx was suspended[3][4] by Christmas Island Internet Administration for AUP[5] violations in response to a complaint, but many mirrors of the site are still available,[6] and the image is displayed on many websites.
In January 2007, Christmas Island Internet Administration put the domain goatse.cx back into the pool of available domains. The domain was subsequently registered on January 16 through domain registrar Variomedia,[7] and the current registrant tried to auction off the right to use the domain.[8]
The goatse.cx domain name was reported sold at an auction on April 30, 2007 to an unknown bidder. According to seobidding.com, the first auction ended with fake bids so the auction was reactivated.[9] This was again won by fake bidders, so Seobidding.com announced that the website would be sold for $500,000 and that legal action would be pursued against the fake bidders.[10] On November 25, 2007, the site was for sale on seobidding; "goatse.cx asking: $50200 minimum."
Control of the domain was passed to the secondary market, and was taken by domain squatters who were trying to sell the domain name for 10,000 euros.[11]
As January 2008, the front page of the site features a stylized rendering of the Goatse.cx image and notification that the goatse.cx domain is once again for sale.

Goatse.cx had four sections, two of which had images intended to shock the viewer:

The site used the .cx country code, the top-level domain of the Australian territory of Christmas Island. The actual server of Goatse.cx was not located on Christmas Island, but in the United States and was owned by Hick.org, a website about computer programming and bathroom humor. The Hick.org domain was registered by Matt Miller in Overland Park, Kansas.[15] Both Goatse.cx and Hick.org originated from the same IP address; the server was located in Kansas City, Missouri, metro-region. Goat.cx, formerly a mirror of Goatse.cx, was located in the Dallas, Texas, metro-region, while current mirror Goatse.fr is in France.

Because many frequent Internet users have been tricked into viewing the site at one time or another,[17] it has become something of an Internet meme.[18] As such, hello.jpg and the other images on the site are common subjects of parodies and tributes.[19]
Following Hurricane Charley in August 2004, a photograph purporting to show "the hands of God" in the cloud formations in the aftermath of the disaster circulated via email. The image was eventually proven to be a fabricated Goatse.cx parody.[20]
In June 2007, a parody of the 2012 Summer Olympics logo submitted by "Sean Stayte" appeared on the BBC News website[21][16] under the alternative Olympic Logo entries and was broadcast on their BBC News 24 channel. Two hands were pulling the 0 from 2012 apart. The image was later shown as part of a gallery of viewers logos on BBC London News and BBC News 24, and was subsequently removed from the website. The editor of the BBC News website acknowledged the mistake in his blog, saying his team "simply didn’t spot it".[22]
