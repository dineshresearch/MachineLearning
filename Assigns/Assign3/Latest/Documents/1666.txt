Theism
Theism in the broadest sense is the belief in at least one deity.[1][2] In a specific sense in current usage, theism generally refers to a particular doctrine concerning the nature of God and his relationship to the universe.[3] Theism, in this specific sense, conceives of God as personal and active in the governance and organization of the world and the universe. The use of the word theism as indicating a particular doctrine of monotheism arose in the wake of the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century to contrast with the then emerging deism which contended that God â€” though transcendent and supreme â€” did not intervene in the natural world and could be known rationally but not via revelation.[4]
The term "theism" derives from the Greek theos meaning God. The term theism was first used by Ralph Cudworth (1617â€“1688).[5]


Monotheism is the belief that there is only one deity. [6]
Three religions are sometimes cited as the earliest known forms of monotheism still in practice today: Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and pre-Vedic Brahmanism,[citation needed] though originally all could have been described as henotheistic. Monotheism is sometimes sourced to the Egyptian religion of Atenism, which is no longer widely practiced.

While a specific definition of theism may exclude polytheism, it is included by the most general definition. Polytheism is the belief that there is more than one deity.[7] In practice, polytheism is not just the belief that there are multiple gods; it usually includes belief in the existence of a specific pantheon of distinct deities.
Within polytheism there are hard and soft varieties:
Polytheism is also divided according to how the individual deities are regarded:

While a specific definition of theism may exclude pantheism, it is included by the most general definition.
Some philosophers find the distinction between pantheism and panentheism to be ambiguous.[citation needed]

While a specific definition of theism may exclude deism, it is included by the most general definition.

While a specific definition of theism may exclude autotheism, it is included by the most general definition. Autotheism is the viewpoint that, whether divinity is also external or not, it is inherently within 'oneself' and that one's duty is to become perfect; divine. This can either be in a selfish, wilful, egotistical way or a selfless way following the implications of Jesus Christ's statements and canon, outright suggestions made by him,[vague] Buddha, and other ethical philosophy/religion founders.[citation needed]
