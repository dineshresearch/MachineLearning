Thelema
Thelema is a philosophy of life based on the rule or law, "Do what thou wilt." The ideal of "Do what thou wilt" and its association with the word Thelema goes back to Fran√ßois Rabelais, but was more fully developed[1] and proselytized[2] by Aleister Crowley,who founded a religion named Thelema based on this ideal. The word itself is the English transliteration of the Koine Greek noun Œ∏Œ≠ŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ±: "will", from the verb Œ∏Œ≠Œªœâ: to will, wish, purpose. Early Christian writings use the word to refer to the will of God,[3] the human will,[4] and even the will of God's opponent, the Devil.[5]
In the 16th century, Fran√ßois Rabelais used Th√©l√®me, the French form of the word, as the name of a fictional Abbey in his famous books, Gargantua and Pantagruel.[6][7] The only rule of this Abbey was "fay √ße que vouldras" ("Fais ce que tu veux," or, "Do what thou wilt"). This rule was revived and used in the real world in the mid 18th century by Sir Francis Dashwood, who inscribed it on a doorway of his abbey at Medmenham,[8][9][10][11] where it served as the motto of The Hellfire Club.[8]
The same rule was used in 1904 by Aleister Crowley[11][12][13] in The Book of the Law. This book contains both the phrase "Do what thou wilt" and the word Thelema in Greek, which Crowley took for the name of the philosophical, mystical and religious system which he subsequently developed. This system includes ideas from occultism, Yoga, and both Eastern and Western mysticism (especially the Qabalah).[14]
Shri Gurudev Mahendranath, in speaking of svecchachara, the Sanskrit equivalent of the phrase "Do what thou wilt",[15][16][17] wrote that "Rabelais, Dashwood, and Crowley must share the honor of perpetuating what has been such a high ideal in most of Asia."[11]

The word Œ∏Œ≠ŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ± (thelema) is rare in classical Greek, where it "signifies the appetitive will: desire, sometimes even sexual",[18] but it is frequent in the Septuagint[18] and central to the Gospels,[19] referring to the will of God.[18] One well-known example is in the "Lord's Prayer" (Matthew 6:10), ‚ÄúYour kingdom come. Your will (ŒòŒµŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ±) be done, On earth as it is in heaven.‚Äù It is used later in the same Gospel (26:42), "He went away again a second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done."
In his 5th century Sermon on 1 John 7-8, Augustine of Hippo gave an instruction that surprises some,[20] "Love, and do what you will" (Dilige et quod vis fac) .[21]
In the Renaissance, a character named "Thelemia" represents will or desire in the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili of the Dominican monk Francesco Colonna.[22] Colonna's work was, in turn, a great influence on the Franciscan monk Francois Rabelais, whose Gargantua and Pantagruel includes an Abbey of Th√©l√®me.[23][22]

Fran√ßois Rabelais was a Franciscan and later a Benedictine monk of the 16th century. Eventually he left the monastery to study medicine, and so moved to Lyon in 1532. It was there that he wrote Gargantua and Pantagruel, a connected series of books. They tell the story of two giants‚Äîa father (Gargantua) and his son (Pantagruel) and their adventures‚Äîwritten in an amusing, extravagant, and satirical vein.
It is in the first book (ch. 52-57) where Rabelais writes of the Abbey of Th√©l√®me, built by the giant Gargantua. It pokes fun at the monastic institutions, since his abbey has a swimming pool, maid service, and no clocks in sight.[6]
One of the verses of the inscription on the gate to Th√©l√®me says:
Grace, honour, praise, delight,
Here sojourn day and night.
†††Sound bodies lined
†††With a good mind,
Do here pursue with might
Grace, honour, praise, delight.
But below the humour was a very real concept of utopia and the ideal society.[24] Rabelais gives us a description of how the Thelemites of the Abbey lived and the rules they lived by:
All their life was spent not in laws, statutes, or rules, but according to their own free will and pleasure. They rose out of their beds when they thought good; they did eat, drink, labour, sleep, when they had a mind to it and were disposed for it. None did awake them, none did offer to constrain them to eat, drink, nor to do any other thing; for so had Gargantua established it. In all their rule and strictest tie of their order there was but this one clause to be observed,
Some scholars argue that Martin Luther influenced Rabelais, and that the French author wrote from a specifically Christian perspective.[citation needed] In particular, Alexander Pocetto of the Allentown College of St. Francis de Sales draws many parallels between Rabelais and Francis de Sales.[3] Erich Auerbach disagrees, writing that the revolutionary thing about Rabelais' way of thinking "is not his opposition to Christianity, but the freedom of vision, feeling and thought which his perpetual playing with things produces, and which invites the reader to deal directly with the world and its wealth of phenomena. On one point, to be sure, Rabelais takes a stand, and it is a stand which is basically anti-Christian; for him, the man who follows his nature is good, and natural life, be it of men or things, is good..."[25]

Sir Francis Dashwood adopted some of the ideas of Rabelais and invoked the same rule in French when he founded a group called the Monks of Medmenham (better known as The Hellfire Club).[8][10][11] An abbey was established at Medmenham, described in the 1911 Britannica as follows:
At Medmenham, on the Thames above Marlow, there are fragments, incorporated into a residence, of a Cistercian abbey founded in 1201; which became notorious in the middle of the 18th century as the meeting-place of a convivial club called the Franciscans after its founder, Sir Francis Dashwood, afterwards Lord le Despencer (1708-1781), and also known as the Hell-Fire Club, of which John Wilkes, Bubb Dodington and other political notorieties were members. The motto of the club, fay Ce que voudras (do what you will), inscribed on a doorway at the abbey, was borrowed from Rabelais description of the abbey of Thelema in Gargantua.[8]
We have little direct evidence of what Dashwood's Hellfire Club did or believed.[26] The one direct testimonial comes from John Wilkes, a member who never got into the chapter-room of the inner circle.[26][27] He describes their origin as follows:
A set of worthy, jolly fellows, happy disciples of Venus and Bacchus, got occasionally together to celebrate woman in wine and to give more zest to the festive meeting, they plucked every luxurious idea from the ancients and enriched their own modern pleasures with the tradition of classic luxury.[28]
The group derived more from Rabelais than the inscription over the door, in the opinion of Lt.-Col. Towers, who wrote "My interpretation of the caves remains as stated, that they were used as a Dionysian oracular temple, based upon Dashwood‚Äôs reading of the relevant chapters of Rabelais."[29]
Sir Nathaniel Wraxall in his Historical Memoires (1815) accused the Monks of performing Satanic rituals, but these claims have been dismissed as hearsay.[26] Gerald Gardner and others such as Mike Howard[30] say the Monks worshipped "the Goddess." Daniel Willens argued that the group likely practiced Freemasonry, but also suggests Dashwood may have held secret Roman Catholic sacraments. He asks if Wilkes would have recognized a genuine Catholic Mass, even if he saw it himself and even if the underground version followed its public model precisely.[31] The Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon minimizes the connection with Freemasonry.[26]

Later, Sir Walter Besant and James Rice referred to Rabelais' Abbey of Thelema in their novel The Monks of Thelema (1878), as did C.R. Ashbee in his utopian romance The Building of Thelema (1910).
People living between Rabelais and Crowley sometimes used the word "Thelemites" to mean people who do as they please.[32] Sometimes they even used the term positively, but did so with some degree of secrecy and deniability.[33]

Aleister Crowley (1875‚Äì1947) was an English occultist, writer, and social provocateur. Rabelais was one of Crowley's heroes[34] and his books Gargantua and Pantagruel may have provided Crowley with part of the philosophic basis for the Law of Thelema,[1][12][13][35][11] namely the phrase "Do what thou wilt".[36] In The Antecedents of Thelema, Crowley referred to Rabelais as "Our Master",[37] and Rabelais was also included among the Saints of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica along with Virgil, Catullus and Swinburne.[38]
In 1904, Crowley claimed to have received Liber AL vel Legis, the Book of the Law from an entity named Aiwass, which was to serve as the foundation of the religious and philosophical system he called Thelema.[7][39] Crowley summed up his Law of Thelema[40] in these phrases from the Book:
Shri Gurudev Mahendranath and others have written that Crowley revived the Thelemic Law from Rabelais.[1][10][11][13] Aleister Crowley wrote in The Antecedents of Thelema (1926) that Rabelais "set forth in essence the Law of Thelema, very much as it is understood by the Master Therion himself," and further that "the masterpiece of Rabelais contains in singular perfection a clear forecast of the Book which was to be revealed by Aiwass to Ankh-f-n-khonsu 370 years later."[37] But Crowley biographer Lawrence Sutin disagrees, writing that in his opinion,
Questions of prophecy aside, Rabelais was no precursor of Thelema. Joyous and unsystematic, Rabelais blended in his heterodox creed elements of Stoic self-mastery and spontaneous Christian faith and kindness.[2]

Crowley's system of Thelema begins with The Book of the Law, which bears the official name Liber AL vel Legis. It was written in Cairo, Egypt during his honeymoon with his new wife Rose Crowley (n√©e Kelly). This small book contains three chapters, each of which he wrote in one hour, beginning at noon, on April 8, April 9, and April 10, 1904. Crowley claims that he took dictation from an entity named Aiwass, whom he later identified as his own Holy Guardian Angel.[44] However, an analysis by Dan Evans shows similarities not only with Rabelais, but also to The Beloved of Hathor and Shrine of the Golden Hawk,[45] a play by Florence Farr.[46]
Crowley wrote several commentaries on The Book of the Law, the last of which he wrote in 1925. This brief statement called simply "The Comment" warns against the study of the Book and discussing its contents, and states that all "questions of the Law are to be decided only by appeal to my writings" and is signed Ankh-af-na-khonsu.[47] The only known writings of Ankh-af-na-khonsu appear on the St√®le of Revealing.

According to Crowley, every individual has a True Will, to be distinguished from the ordinary wants and desires of the ego. The True Will is essentially one's "calling" or "purpose" in life. Crowley's concept assumes that this includes the goal of attaining self-realization by one's own efforts, without the aid of God or other divine authority.[48] Crowley was more specific about the True Will of women. He wrote that "women are nearly always conscious of an important part of their true Will; the bearing of children. To them nothing else is serious in comparison..."[49] (For more context on Crowley's apparent sexism, see Aleister Crowley#Sexism).
Crowley believed that in order to discover the True Will, one had to free the desires of the subconscious mind from the control of the conscious mind, especially the restrictions placed on sexual expression, which he associated with the power of divine creation.[50] He taught that the True Will of each individual was identified with the Holy Guardian Angel, a
