Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD or ADHD) is a neurobehavioral[1] developmental disorder.[2] It affects about 3 to 5% of children with symptoms starting before seven years of age.[3] Global prevalence for children is approximately 5%, with wide variability dependent on research methodologies utilized in studies.[4] It is characterized by a persistent pattern of impulsiveness and inattention, with or without a component of hyperactivity.[5] ADHD is twice as common in boys as in girls[6], though studies suggest this discrepancy may be due to subjective bias.[7] ADHD is generally a chronic[8] disorder with 30 to 50% of individuals diagnosed in childhood continuing to have symptoms into adulthood.[9][10] As they mature, adolescents and adults with ADHD are likely to develop coping mechanisms to compensate for their impairment.[11]
Though previously regarded as a childhood diagnosis, ADHD can continue throughout adulthood.[12] ADHD has a strong genetic component.[13]
Methods of treatment usually involve some combination of medications, behavior modifications, life-style changes, and counseling. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that stimulant medications and/or behavior therapy are appropriate and generally safe treatments for ADHD.[14] However, a 2006 meta-analysis found a lack of data regarding ADHD drugs' potential adverse effects,[15] with very few studies assessing the safety or efficacy of treatments beyond 4 months,[16] and no randomized controlled trials assessing either for periods of usage longer than two years.[17][18][12] Treatment of pre-school children is not recommended.[19]
ADHD and its diagnosis and treatment have been considered controversial since the 1970s.[20][21][22][23] The controversies have involved clinicians, teachers, policymakers, parents, and the media, with opinions regarding ADHD that range from not believing it exists at all to believing there are genetic and physiological bases for the condition, and also include disagreement about the use of stimulant medications in treatment.[21]

ADHD may be seen as an extreme of one or more continuous traits found throughout the population.[19] ADHD is a developmental disorder in which certain traits such as impulse control lag in development when compared to the general population.[24] Using magnetic resonance imaging of the prefrontal cortex, this developmental lag has been estimated to range from 3 to 5 years.[25] These delays are considered to cause impairment. ADHD has also been classified as a behavior disorder.[26] A diagnosis of ADHD does not, however, imply a neurological disease.[19]
ADHD is classified as a disruptive behavior disorder along with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and antisocial disorder.[27]

The most common symptoms[28][29] of ADHD are:
The DSM-IV categorizes the symptoms of ADHD into three clusters, referred to as subtypes: (1) Inattentive; (2) hyperactive/impulsive; and (3) combined.[30] Most people exhibit some of these behaviors but not to the point where they significantly interfere with a person's work, relationships, or studies. ADHD may accompany other disorders such as anxiety or depression.
Hyperactivity is common among children with ADHD but tends to disappear during adulthood. However, over half of children with ADHD continue to have some symptoms of inattention throughout their lives.
Inattention and "hyperactive" behavior are not the only problems in children with ADHD. ADHD exists alone in only about 1/3 of the children diagnosed with it. Many co-existing conditions require other courses of treatment and should be diagnosed separately instead of being grouped in the ADHD diagnosis. Some of the associated conditions are:

A specific cause of ADHD is not known.[33] There are, however, a number of factors that may contribute to ADHD including genetics, diet and social and physical environments.

Twin studies indicate that the disorder is highly heritable and that genetics are a factor in about 75% of ADHD cases.[19] Hyperactivity also seems to be primarily a genetic condition; however, other causes do have an effect.[34]
Researchers believe that a large majority of ADHD cases arise from a combination of various genes, many of which affect dopamine transporters. Candidate genes include dopamine transporter, dopamine receptor D4, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, monoamine oxidase A, catecholamine-methyl transferase, serotonin transporter promoter (SLC6A4), 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2A), 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B receptor (5-HT1B),[35] the 10-repeat allele of the DAT1 gene,[36] the 7-repeat allele of the DRD4 gene,[36] and the dopamine beta hydroxylase gene (DBH TaqI).[37]
The broad selection of targets indicates that ADHD does not follow the traditional model of a "genetic disease" and should therefore be viewed as a complex interaction among genetic and environmental factors. Even though all these genes might play a role, to date no single gene has been shown to make a major contribution to ADHD.[38]

Twin studies to date have also suggested that approximately 9% to 20% of the variance in hyperactive-impulsive-inattentive behavior or ADHD symptoms can be attributed to nonshared environmental (nongenetic) factors.[39][40]
Environmental factors implicated include alcohol and tobacco smoke exposure during pregnancy and environmental exposure to lead in very early life.[41] The relation of smoking to ADHD could be due to nicotine causing hypoxia (lack of oxygen) to the fetus in utero.[42] It could also be that women with ADHD are more likely to smoke[43] and therefore, due to the strong genetic component of ADHD, are more likely to have children with ADHD.[44] Complications during pregnancy and birth—including premature birth—might also play a role.[45]


A meta-analysis has found that dietary elimination of artificial food coloring and preservatives provides a statistically significant benefit in children with ADHD.[46] Other more recent studies agree with these conclusions.[47][48]
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed the literature on the association between food additives and hyperactivity and concluded that there is only limited evidence of an association between the intake of additives and activity and attention, and then only in some children studied. They further indicated that the effects reported in the study were not consistent for the two age groups and for the two food additive mixtures used in the study.[49] Others have suggested a trial of removing additives from the diet for children with ADHD as it is harmless and might be helpful.[50]
The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) has called for a ban on the use of six artificial food colorings[51] and the European Union (EU) has ruled that some food dyes must be labeled with the relevant E number as well as this warning: "may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children."[52]

A number of studies have found that sucrose (sugar) has no effect on behavior and in particular it does not exacerbate the symptoms of children diagnosed with ADHD.[53][54][55] Corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup, the sugars found in most sweets, were not part of any of these studies.

Preliminary research suggests that Omega-3 supplementation might be effective in the treatment of ADHD; however, some of the studies give conflicting results. [56]

There is no compelling evidence that social factors alone can cause ADHD.[24] Many researchers believe that relationships with caregivers have a profound effect on attentional and self-regulatory abilities. A study of foster children found that a high number of them had symptoms closely resembling ADHD,[57] while other researchers have found behavior typical of ADHD in children who have suffered violence and emotional abuse.[58][19] Furthermore, Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder can result in attention problems that can look like ADHD.[citation needed] ADHD is considered a contributing factor to Sensory Integration Disorders.[59]


The hunter vs. farmer theory is a hypothesis proposed by author Thom Hartmann about the origins of ADHD. He believes that these conditions may be a result of adaptive behavior of the human species. His theory states that those with ADHD retain some of the older "hunter" characteristics associated with early pre-agricultural human society.[60]

Proponents of this theory assert that atypical (neurodivergent) neurological development is a normal human difference that is to be tolerated and respected just like any other human difference. Social critics argue that while biological factors may play a large role in difficulties with sitting still in class and/or concentrating on schoolwork in some children, these children could have failed to integrate others' social expectations of their behavior for a variety of other reasons.[61]

Some social critics question whether or not ADHD is wholly or even predominantly a biological illness. A minority of these critics maintain that ADHD was "invented and not discovered." They believe that no such disorder exists and that the behavior observed is not abnormal and can better be explained by environmental causes or simply the personality of the "patient."[19]

The low arousal theory explains that people with ADHD seek self-stimulation or excessive activity in order to ascend their state of abnormally low arousal.[62][63] The theory states that those with ADHD cannot self-moderate, and their attention can only be gained by means of environmental stimuli.[62]
One with ADHD creates a great deal of theta brainwaves, which are slow and create a haze through which high levels of physical activity or stimulation can pass. The theory explains, that among many other tendencies and preferences for high-stimulation activities in ADHD subjects, why an activity of high stimulation, such as playing a video game, attracts more attention from an ADHD child than reading a novel, which is a low-stimulation activity.
Without enough stimulation coming from the environment, an ADHD child will create it him or herself by walking around, fidgeting, talking, etc. This theory also explains why stimulant medications have high success rates and can induce a calming effect at therapeutic dosages among children with ADHD. It establishes a strong link with scientific data that ADHD is connected to abnormalities with the neurochemical dopamine and a powerful link with low-stimulation PET scan results in ADHD subjects.

ADHD patients have been observed to have higher than average rates of head injuries;[64] however, current evidence does not indicate that head injuries are the cause of ADHD in the patients observed.[65]
