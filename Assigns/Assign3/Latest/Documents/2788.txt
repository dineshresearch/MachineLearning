Marissa Mayer
Marissa Ann Mayer (born on 30 May 1975) is the Vice President of Search Product and User Experience at the search engine company Google. She acts as a gatekeeper for their product release process, determining when or whether a particular Google product is ready to be released to users. She has become one of the public faces of Google, providing a number of press interviews and appearing at events frequently to speak on behalf of the company.[1]

She received her B.S. in Symbolic systems and M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford University. Mayer was the first female engineer hired at Google and one of their first 20 employees, joining the company in early 1999.

Mayer has notable public involvement with Google Search and Gmail, and can be considered significantly responsible for the success of these UIs.
Some controversy exists regarding the perceived 'glass ceiling' and limited involvement of lower level web-designers and Google teams, beneath her.[2]
