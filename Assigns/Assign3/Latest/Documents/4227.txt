Kotatsu
A kotatsu (炬燵 ?) is a low, wooden table frame covered by a futon, or heavy blanket, upon which a table top sits. Underneath is a heat source, often built into the table itself. Kotatsu are used almost exclusively in Japan, although a similar product called a korsi is also used in Iran.

There are two kinds of kotatsu used in Japan today, differing in the configuration and the type of heating:

Generally, a blanket is draped over the frame under the table-top. A person then sits on the floor with their legs (or most of their body if napping) under the table with the blanket draped over the lower body. Though this only heats up the lower body, it can keep one quite comfortable even in an unheated/under-heated room. In the summer, the blanket may be removed and the kotatsu can be used as a normal table.
Most Japanese housing is un- or under-insulated, with no central heating; thus relying primarily on space heating. Heating is expensive because of the lack of insulation, and the draftiness of housing. A kotatsu is a relatively inexpensive way to stay warm in the winter, as the futons trap the warm air.
The kotatsu was designed for people wearing traditional Japanese style clothes, where the heat would enter through the bottom of the robes and exit around the neck, thus heating the entire body.
