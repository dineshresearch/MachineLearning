Bildungsroman
A bildungsroman (IPA:†[Ààb…™ld ä≈ãs.roÀåmaÀên]; German: "novel of education") is a novelistic genre that arose during the German Enlightenment, in which the author presents the psychological, moral and social shaping of the personality of a (usually young) protagonist. An example of this would be James Joyce's Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man. The term was coined by Johann Carl Simon Morgenstern.[1]

The bildungsroman generally takes the following course[2]:
Within the broader genre, an entwicklungsroman is a story of general growth rather than self-culture, an erziehungsroman focuses on training and formal education, and a k√ºnstlerroman is about the development of an artist and shows a growth of the self.
Many other genres, separate from the bildungsroman genre, can include elements of the bildungsroman as a prominent part of their story lines, while not in themselves fitting the criteria of the bildungsroman. A military story will frequently show a raw recruit receiving a baptism by fire and becoming a battle-hardened soldier, while a high-fantasy quest may show a transformation from an adolescent protagonist into an adult aware of his powers or lineage. Neither of those genres or stories, however, corresponds exactly to the bildungsroman.

This is by no means an attempt to produce a complete list of works within the genre, but instead, a partial list, intended to demonstrate select works that are widely acknowledged to be representative of the genre.
