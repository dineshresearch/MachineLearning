Diane Arbus
Diane Arbus was an American photographer.

Diane Arbus (n√©e Nemerov) was born in New York City into a wealthy family, [1] the younger sister of Howard Nemerov, who served as United States Poet Laureate on two separate occasions. She attended the Fieldston School for Ethical Culture.
Edward Steichen's noted photo exhibit, The Family of Man, included a photograph credited to Diane Arbus and her husband.[2]
One of Arbus' studies included such people as Gloria Vanderbilt's then-infant son, future CNN anchorman Anderson Cooper, for Harper's Bazaar.[3]


In 2006, the film Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus was released, starring Nicole Kidman as Arbus. It used Patricia Bosworth's book Diane Arbus: A Biography as a source.
