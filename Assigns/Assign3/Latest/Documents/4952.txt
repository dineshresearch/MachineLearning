Here Comes Everybody
Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations is 2008 book by Clay Shirky which evaluates the effect of the Internet on modern group dynamics. The author considers examples such as Wikipedia and MySpace in his analysis.
The author says the book is about "what happens when people are given the tools to do things together, without needing traditional organizational structures".[1]
The title of the work is taken from James Joyce's Finnegans Wake.[2]

The Bookseller declared the book one of the two "most reviewed" books over the Easter weekend, noting that the Telegraph's reviewer Dibbell found it "as crisply argued and as enlightening a book about the internet as has been written" and the Guardian reviewer Stuart Jeffries called it "terrifically clever' and 'harrowing".[3]
