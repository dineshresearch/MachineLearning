Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity
The Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity is a list maintained by UNESCO with pieces of intangible culture considered relevant by that organization. It was started in 2001 with 19 items and a further 28 were added in 2003. On November 25, 2005 another list was issued.
Each item is nominated by a country or more than one country. Some other items are nominated by one country but supported by one or more others.
In 2003 Member states of UNESCO adopted the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage. As it entered into force in April 2006, the proclamation programme ended.
