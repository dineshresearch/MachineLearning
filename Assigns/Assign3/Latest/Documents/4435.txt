Kobe beef
Kobe beef (神戸ビーフ ,Kōbe Bīfu?) refers to beef from the black Tajima-ushi breed of Wagyu cattle, raised according to strict tradition in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. Kobe beef is renowned for its flavour, tenderness, and fatty well-marbled texture. Kobe beef can be prepared as steak, sukiyaki, shabu shabu, sashimi, teppanyaki, ground hamburger patties and more.
Kobe beef is also called "Kobe-niku" (神戸肉 ?, lit. Kobe meat), "Kobe-gyū" (神戸牛 ?, lit Kobe cow) or "Kobe-ushi" (神戸牛 ?, lit Kobe cow) in Japanese. [1].

Kobe beef in Japan is registered trademark by Kobe beef distribution promotion conference.[2] It must fulfill all the conditions as follows:[3]
In accordance with popular belief, the cattle are fed a beer a day, and they are massaged and brushed for setting fur, and fed on grain fodder.[5][6] When the cattle are ready for slaughter, they are slaughtered in a humane and painless customary way in order to keep the meat tender and at its highest flavor. A Kobe beef distribution promotion conference plans to make a pamphlet in foreign languages detailing Kobe beef due to the ambiguation of what actually constitutes Kobe beef, and the fact many tourists who visit Japan receive incorrect information.[7]


The massive increase in popularity of Kobe beef in the United States has led to the creation of "Kobe-style" beef, taken from domestically-raised Wagyu crossbred with Angus cattle, in order to meet the demand. Farms in America and Britain have attempted to replicate the Kobe traditions, providing their Wagyu herds beer and daily massages.[8] U.S meat producers claim that any differences between their less expensive "Kobe-style" beef and true Kobe beef are largely cosmetic.[9] This has been brought into question, however, because the cattle are fed American and/or British grass and grain, which is different from the more expensive Japanese feed.[10]
After all beef imports into the USA from Japan were banned on September 10, 2001, due to the discovery of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as Mad-Cow Disease (MCD),[11] many retailers began to heavily market the U.S. raised beef as "Kobe-style". The ban on the import of Wagyu beef to the United States ended on December 12, 2005.[12]
