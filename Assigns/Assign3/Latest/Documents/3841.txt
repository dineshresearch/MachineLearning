Argentina
Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic (Spanish: RepÃºblica Argentina, Spanish pronunciation: [reËˆpuÎ²lika aÉ¾xenËˆtina]), is a country in South America, constituted as a federation of 23 provinces and an autonomous city. It is the second largest country in South America and eighth in the world by land area and the largest among Spanish-speaking nations, though Mexico, Colombia and Spain are more populous. Its continental area is 2,766,890 square kilometres (1,068,300 sq mi), between the Andes mountain range in the west and the southern Atlantic Ocean in the east and south. Argentina borders Paraguay and Bolivia to the north, Brazil and Uruguay to the northeast, and Chile to the west and south. Argentina also claimed 969,464 square kilometres (374,312 sq mi) of Antarctica, known as Argentine Antarctica, overlapping other claims made by Chile (Chilean Antarctic Territory) and the United Kingdom (British Antarctic Territory); all such claims have been suspended by the Antarctic Treaty of 1961.
Argentina has the second highest Human Development Index level[5] and the second highest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in purchasing power parity in Latin America.[6] Argentina's nominal GDP is the 30th largest in the world;[7] but when purchasing power is taken into account, its total GDP makes it the 23rd largest economy in the world.[8]
The country is currently classified as an Upper-Middle Income Country[9] or as a secondary emerging market by the World Bank.[10][11] Argentina is also one of the G-20 major economies.


The total surface area of Argentina (not including the Antarctic claim) is 2,766,891 km2 (1,068,303 sq mi), of which 2,736,691 km2 (1,056,642 sq mi) is land and 30,200 km2 (11,700 sq mi) (1.1%) is water.
Argentina is about 3,900 km (2,500 mi) long from north to south, and 1,400 km (870 mi) from east to west (maximum values). It can roughly be divided into four parts: the fertile plains of the Pampas in the center of the country, the source of Argentina's agricultural wealth; the flat to rolling, oil-rich plateau of Patagonia in the southern half down to Tierra del Fuego; the subtropical flats of the Gran Chaco in the north, and the rugged Andes mountain range along the western border with Chile.
The highest point above sea level in Argentina is located in Mendoza. Cerro Aconcagua, at 6,962 meters (22,834 ft). It is the highest mountain in the Americas, the Southern,[12] and Western Hemisphere.[13] The lowest point is Laguna del CarbÃ³n in Santa Cruz, âˆ’105 meters (âˆ’344 ft) below sea level.[14] This is also the lowest point on the South American continent. The geographic center of the country is located in south-central La Pampa Province.
Argentina's easternmost continental point is northeast of the town of Bernardo de Irigoyen, Misiones (26Â°15â€²S 53Â°38â€²Wï»¿ / ï»¿26.25Â°S 53.633Â°Wï»¿ / -26.25; -53.633ï»¿ (Argentina's easternmost continental point)), the westernmost in the Mariano Moreno Range in Santa Cruz (49Â°33â€²S 73Â°35â€²Wï»¿ / ï»¿49.55Â°S 73.583Â°Wï»¿ / -49.55; -73.583ï»¿ (Argentina's westernmost point)). The northernmost point is located at the confluence of the Grande de San Juan and Mojinete rivers, Jujuy (21Â°46â€²S 66Â°13â€²Wï»¿ / ï»¿21.767Â°S 66.217Â°Wï»¿ / -21.767; -66.217ï»¿ (Argentina's northernmost point)), and the southernmost is Cape San PÃ­o in Tierra del Fuego (55Â°03â€²S 66Â°31â€²Wï»¿ / ï»¿55.05Â°S 66.517Â°Wï»¿ / -55.05; -66.517ï»¿ (Argentina's southernmost point)).[15]
The country has a territorial claim over a portion of Antarctica (unrecognized by any other country), where, from 1904, it has maintained a constant presence.

The country is traditionally divided into several major geographically distinct regions:
