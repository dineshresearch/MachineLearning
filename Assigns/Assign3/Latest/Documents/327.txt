Transtheoretical model
The transtheoretical model in health psychology is intended to explain or predict a person's success or failure in achieving a proposed behavior change, such as developing different habits. It attempts to answer why the change "stuck" or alternatively why the change was not made.
The transtheoretical model is also known by the acronym "TTM"[1] and by the term "stages of change model"[2][3]. A popular book[4] and articles in the newsmedia[5][6][7][8][9] have discussed the model. It is "arguably the dominant model of health behaviour change, having received unprecedented research attention, yet it has simultaneously attracted exceptional criticism"[10].

James O. Prochaska of the University of Rhode Island and colleagues developed the transtheoretical model beginning in 1977[11]. It is based on an analysis of different theories of psychotherapy[12], hence the name "transtheoretical." The original model consisted of four variables: "preconditions for therapy," "processes of change," "content to be changed," and "therapeutic relationship"[13].
Prochaska and colleagues later refined the model on the basis of research that they published in peer-reviewed journals and books[14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27]. By 1997, the model consisted of five "core constructs": "stages of change," "processes of change," "decisional balance," "self-efficacy," and "temptation"[26].

In the transtheoretical model as of 1997, change is a "process involving progress through a series of six stages"[26]:
In addition, the researchers conceptualized "relapse" which is not a stage in itself but rather the "return from action or maintenance to an earlier stage"[26][nb 3].

The 10 processes of change are "covert and overt activities that people use to progress through the stages"[26]. These processes are most emphasized at different transitions between stages of change[26][nb 4]:
Prochaska and colleagues state that their research related to the transtheoretical model suggests that interventions to change behavior must be "stage-matched," that is, "matched to each individual’s stage of change"[26].

This core construct "reflects the individual’s relative weighing of the pros and cons of changing"[26][nb 6].

This core construct is "the situation-specific confidence people have that they can cope with high risk situations without relapsing to their unhealthy or high risk habit"[26][nb 7].

This core construct "reflects the intensity of urges to engage in a specific habit when in the midst of difficult situations"[26][nb 8].

Among the criticisms of the model are the following:
