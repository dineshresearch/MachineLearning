How to Solve It
George Pólya's 1945 book How to Solve It is a small volume describing methods of problem solving.[1]

This book was published at Princeton University. It suggests the following steps when solving a mathematical problem:
If this technique fails, Pólya advises: "If you can't solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can solve: find it."[2] Or: "If you cannot solve the proposed problem, try to solve first some related problem. Could you imagine a more accessible related problem?"
His book contains a dictionary-style set of heuristics, many of which have to do with generating a more accessible problem. For example:
The technique "have I used everything" is perhaps most applicable to formal educational examinations (e.g., n men digging m ditches) problems.
The book has achieved "classic" status because of its considerable influence (see the next section).
Other books on problem solving are often related to more creative and less concrete techniques. See lateral thinking, mind mapping, brainstorming, and creative problem solving.
