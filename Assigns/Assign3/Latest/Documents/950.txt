Java OpenGL
Java OpenGL (JOGL) is a wrapper library that allows OpenGL to be used in the Java programming language. It is currently being developed by the Game Technology Group at Sun Microsystems, and is the reference implementation for JSR-231 (Java Bindings for OpenGL).
JOGL allows access to most features available to C programming language programmers, with the notable exception of window-system related calls in GLUT (as Java contains its own windowing systems, AWT and Swing), and some extensions.

The base OpenGL C API is accessed in JOGL via Java Native Interface (JNI) calls. As such, the underlying system must support OpenGL for JOGL to work.
JOGL differs from some other Java OpenGL wrapper libraries in that it merely exposes the procedural OpenGL API via methods on a few classes, rather than attempting to map OpenGL functionality onto the object-oriented programming paradigm. Indeed, the majority of the JOGL code is autogenerated from the OpenGL C header files via a conversion tool named Gluegen, which was programmed specifically to facilitate the creation of JOGL.
This design decision has both its advantages and disadvantages. The procedural and state machine nature of OpenGL is inconsistent with the typical method of programming under Java, which is bothersome to many programmers. However, the straightforward mapping of the OpenGL C API to Java methods makes conversion of existing C applications and example code much simpler. The thin layer of abstraction provided by JOGL makes runtime execution quite efficient, but accordingly is more difficult to code compared to higher-level abstraction libraries like Java3D. Because most of the code is autogenerated, changes to OpenGL can be rapidly added to JOGL.

As of 2007, JOGL provides full access to the OpenGL 2.0 specification.
The last 1.1.0 version is the reference implementation for JSR-231 (Java Bindings for OpenGL).
The 1.1.1 release, available as of May 22, 2008 will give limited access to GLU NURBS, providing rendering of curved lines and surfaces via the traditional GLU APIs. It is planned to do a maintenance review of JSR-231 1.1.1 to add NURBS-related entry points to the JSR-231 API.

Since the Java SE 6 version of the Java programming language, Java2D (the API for drawing two dimensional graphics in Java) and JOGL have become interoperable, allowing it to :
