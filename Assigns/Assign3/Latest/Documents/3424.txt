Antimetabole
In rhetoric, antimetabole is the repetition of words in successive clauses, but in transposed grammatical order (e.g., "I know what I like, and I like what I know"). It is similar to chiasmus although chiasmus does not use repetition of the same words or phrases.


It is derived from the Greek ἀντί (antí), "against","opposite" and μεταβολή (metabolē), "turning about", "change".
