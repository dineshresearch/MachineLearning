Jatropha curcas
Jatropha curcas, Barbados nut or Physic nut is a perennial poisonous shrub (normally up to 5 m high[1]) belonging to the Euphorbiaceae or spurge family. It is an uncultivated non-food wild-species.
The plant, originating in Central America [2], whereas it has been spread to other tropical and subtropical countries as well [3] and is mainly grown in Asia and in Africa, where it is known as PourghÃ¨re. It is used as a living fence to protect gardens and fields from animals. [4]
It is resistant to a high degree of aridity (it can be planted even in the desert [5] [6] [7]) and as such does not compete with food crops.
The seeds contain 27-40% oil [8] (average: 34.4% [9]) that can be processed to produce a high-quality biodiesel fuel, usable in a standard diesel engine.


Cultivation is uncomplicated. Jatropha curcas grows in tropical and subtropical regions.[10] The plant can grow in wastelands and grows on almost any terrain, even on gravelly, sandy and saline soils. It can thrive on the poorest stony soil and grow in the crevices of rocks. Complete germination is achieved within 9 days. Adding manure during the germination has negative effects during that phase, but is favorable if applied after germination is achieved. It is usually propagated by cuttings as this yields faster results than multiplication by seeds. The flowers only develop terminally (at the end of a stem), so a good ramification (plants presenting many branches) produces the greatest amount of fruits. Another productivity factor is the ratio between female and male flowers within an inflorescence (usually about 1 female to 10 male flowers - more female flowers mean more fruits)[11]. Jatropha curcas thrives on a mere 250 mm (10 in) of rain a year, and only during its first two years does it need to be watered in the closing days of the dry season. Ploughing and planting are not needed regularly, as this shrub has a life expectancy of approximately forty years. The use of pesticides and other polluting substances are not necessary, due to the pesticidal and fungicidal properties of the plant.
While Jatropha curcas starts yielding from 9â€“12 months time, the effective yield is obtained only after 2 - 3 years time.[12]
If planted in hedges, the reported productivity of Jatropha is from 0.8 kg. to 1.0 kg. of seed per meter of live fence. The seed production is around 3.5 tons / hectare (Seed production ranges from about 0.4 tons per hectare in first year to over 5 tons per hectare after 3 years).

Jatropha curcas has limited potential for vegetative propagation and is usually propagated by seed. It is cross-pollinated and propagation through seed leads to a lot of genetic variability in terms of growth, biomass, seed yield and oil content. Besides, the problems of low viability and recalcitrant nature of oil seeds limits the sexual propagation. On the other hand, clonal techniques will help in overcoming the biological problems hindering mass propagation of this tree-borne oilseed species.
Jatropha curcas can be propagated by seed as well as vegetatively. Propagation by seed. Vegetatively, this crop can be propagated by stem cuttings, grafting, budding as well as by air layering techniques.[13] The investigation leads to the recommendation that cuttings should be taken preferably from juvenile plants and treated with 200 micro gram per litre of IBA (rooting hormone) to ensure the highest level of rooting in stem cuttings of Jatropha curcas. Thus stem cuttings, grafting, budding and air layering methods of propagation could be used as a potential protocol for commercial propagation of Jatropha curcas.

Seed extraction is made simple with the use of the Universal Nut Sheller, an appropriate technology designed by the Full Belly Project.[14]
Oil content varies from 28% to 30% and 94% extraction, one hectare of plantation will give 1.6t (metric tonne) of oil if the soil is average. [15]
The oily seeds are processed into oil, which may be directly used to fuel combustion engines or may be subjected to transesterification to produce biodiesel. Jatropha oil is not suitable for human consumption, as it induces strong vomiting and diarrhea.
A colourant can also be derived from the seed.
