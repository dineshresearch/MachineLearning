Back to Mine
Back to Mine is a series of mix albums, usually (though not always) mixed by renowned DJs or composers of electronic music. The compilations usually feature artists other than the artist compiling the album, and are based on what the artist would play at home after a night out, rather than as part of a nightclub session.
The first volume was released in February 1999 by DJ Nick Warren. Since volume seven, the albums have borne the subtitle "a personal collection for after-hours grooving".
Back to Mine is published by the Dance Music Collective.
