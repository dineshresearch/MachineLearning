Bastard Operator From Hell
The Bastard Operator From Hell (BOFH), a fictional character created by Simon Travaglia, is a rogue system administrator who takes out his anger on users (often referred to as lusers) -- his colleagues, his bosses, and anyone who gets in his way.
The BOFH stories were originally posted in 1992 to Usenet by Travaglia, with some being reprinted in Datamation.[1] They were published weekly from 1995 to 1999 in Network Week and since 2000 they have been published most weeks in The Register. They were also published in PC Plus magazine for a short time, and several books of the stories have also been released.
By extension, the term is also used to refer to any system administrator who displays (or wishes he could get away with) the qualities of the original. The term has become common Internet slang. In the stories the BOFH also spent a brief amount of time as a Bastard System Manager From Hell (BSMFH) â€” however, this has failed to pass into common online parlance.
In the stories, the PFY (Pimply-Faced Youth) is the BOFH's assistant; this too has become a general term for a junior or trainee system administrator.

The stories take place in three locations; early BOFH editions took place in a university, moving on to an office workplace over time (an exact transition is not given). BOFH 2k began with the BOFH and PFY moving to a new company.
Whilst the BOFH gets irritated at the incompetence of users, he does use this to his advantage to further his devious means, mainly using the following tricks:
Early BOFH editions focused mainly on the above tricks, although over time many other schemes and plots have been used, with many now aimed at management as well as the users. Early BOFH editions simply featured the BOFH, the systems manager and the lusers â€” as time developed, the Boss, PFY and other characters (see below) appeared.
An additional technique featured in recent stories is "Wikisalting", which involves the creation of Wikipedia articles by the protagonists to support their theories, excuses or cover ups. Two of the most prominent examples of this technique are the Mandelboozer Virus (also known as Mandelbrot virus, MandelBank virus and Mandelboat virus)[2] and Reggie Moore's Inverse Square Law of IT Satisfaction[3].
