Gut flora
The gut flora consists of the microorganisms that normally live in the digestive tract of animals. Though widely known as the "intestinal microflora", this is technically a misnomer since the word root "flora" pertains to plants and biota refers to microbial life such as bacteria other than plants. Thus recently, the more appropriate term intestinal microbiota is applied, though its use has not eclipsed the entrenched use and recognition of "flora" with regard to intestinal bacteria, and for the time being, both terms are being used in different textbooks.
The average human body, consisting of about 1013 (10,000,000,000,000 or about ten trillion) cells, has about ten times that number of microorganisms in the gut.[1][2][3][4] The metabolic activity performed by these bacteria is equal to that of a virtual organ causing some to describe the gut bacteria as a "forgotten" organ.[5]
Bacteria make up most of the flora in the colon[6] and 60% of the dry mass of feces.[2] This fact makes feces an ideal source to test for gut flora for any tests and experiments by extracting the nucleic acid from fecal specimens, and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences are generated with bacterial primers. This form of testing is ideal when compared to more invasive techniques, such as biopsies. Somewhere between 300[2] and 1000 different species live in the gut,[3] with most estimates at about 500.[5][7][4] However, it is probable that 99% of the bacteria come from about 30 or 40 species.[8] Fungi and protozoa also make up a part of the gut flora, but little is known about their activities.
Research suggests that the relationship between gut flora and humans is not merely commensal (a non-harmful coexistence), but rather is a mutualistic, symbiotic relationship.[3] Though people can survive with no gut flora,[4] the microorganisms perform a host of useful functions, such as fermenting unused energy substrates, training the immune system, preventing growth of harmful species,[2] regulating the development of the gut, producing vitamins for the host (such as biotin and vitamin K), and producing hormones to direct the host to store fats. However, in certain conditions, some species are thought to be capable of causing disease by causing infection or increasing cancer risk for the host.[2][6]

The colon has the greatest numbers of bacteria and the most different species, and the activity of these bacteria make the colon the most metabolically active organ in the body.[7] The acid in the stomach, as well as bile and pancreatic secretions, hinder colonization of most bacteria in the stomach and proximal small intestine.[5] Most of the bacteria in the distal small intestine are Gram-positive, while those in the colon are mostly Gram-negative.[9] The first part of the colon is mostly responsible for fermenting carbohydrates,[8][7][2] while the latter part mostly breaks down proteins and amino acids.[7][2] Bacterial growth is rapid in the cecum and ascending colon, which has a low pH, and slow in the descending colon, which has an almost neutral pH.[2] The body maintains the proper balance and locations of species by altering pH, the activity of the immune system, and peristalsis.[6]
Over 99% of the bacteria in the gut are anaerobes,[8][2][6][3][10] but in the cecum, aerobic bacteria reach high densities.[2]

Not all the species in the gut have been identified[2][3] because some cannot be cultured,[8][3][11] so DNA isolation and identification is difficult.[12] Populations of species vary widely among different individuals but stay fairly constant within an individual over time, even though some alterations may occur with changes in lifestyle, diet and age.[2][5] An effort to better describe the microflora of the gut and other body locations has been initiated; see Human microbiome project.
Most bacteria come from the genera Bacteroides, Clostridium, Fusobacterium,[8][2][10] Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, and Bifidobacterium.[2][8] Other genera such as Escherichia and Lactobacillus are present to a lesser extent.[2] Species from the genus Bacteroides alone constitute about 30% of all bacteria in the gut, suggesting that that genus is especially important in the functioning of the host.[3]
The currently known genera of fungi of the gut flora include Candida, Saccharomyces, Aspergillus, and Penicillium.

The gastrointestinal tract of a normal fetus is sterile. During birth and rapidly thereafter, bacteria from the mother and the surrounding environment colonize the infant's gut. Immediately after vaginal delivery, babies have bacterial strains in the upper gastrointestinal tract derived from the mothers’ feces.[13] Infants born by caesarean section may also be exposed to their mothers’ microflora, but the initial exposure is most likely to be from environmental microbes such as the air, other infants, and the nursing staff which serve as vectors for transfer.[14] The primary gut flora in infants born by cesarean delivery may be disturbed for up to 6 months after birth whereas vaginally born infants take up to 1 month for their intestinal micro flora to be well established. After birth, environmental, oral and cutaneous bacteria are readily transferred from the mother to the infant through suckling, kissing, and caressing. All infants are initially colonized by large numbers of E. coli and streptococci. Within a few days, bacterial numbers reach 108 to 1010 per gram of feces.[14][15] During the first week of life, these bacteria create a reducing environment favorable for the subsequent bacterial succession of strict anaerobic species mainly belonging to the genera Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Ruminococcus.[16] Breast-fed babies become dominated by bifidobacteria, possibly due to the contents of bifidobacterial growth factors in breast milk.[17] In contrast, the microbiota of formula-fed infants is more diverse with high numbers of Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, and clostridia.[18][19] After the introduction of solid food and weaning, the microflora of breast-fed infants becomes similar to that of formula-fed infants. By the second year of life the fecal microflora resembles that of adults.

Bacteria in the gut fulfills a host of useful functions for humans, including digestion of unutilized energy substrates;[20] stimulating cell growth; repressing the growth of harmful microorganisms; training the immune system to respond only to pathogens; and defending against some diseases.[2][3][21]

Without gut flora, the human body would be unable to utilize some of the undigested carbohydrates it consumes, because some types of gut flora have enzymes that human cells lack for breaking down certain polysaccharides.[3] Rodents raised in a sterile environment and lacking in gut flora need to eat 30% more calories just to remain the same weight as their normal counterparts.[3] Carbohydrates that humans cannot digest without bacterial help include certain starches; fiber; oligosaccharides and sugars that the body failed to digest and absorb[7][2][8] like lactose in the case of lactose intolerance and sugar alcohols, mucus produced by the gut, and proteins.[7]
Bacteria turn carbohydrates they ferment into short chain fatty acids, or SCFAs.[7][6][8] These materials can be used by host cells, providing a major source of useful energy and nutrients for humans.[7] They increase the gut's absorption of water, reduce counts of damaging bacteria, increase growth of human gut cells,[6] and are also used for the growth of indigenous bacteria.[2] The SCFAs are produced by a form of fermentation called saccharolytic fermentation[7] and include acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid.[7][6][8] Gases and organic acids like lactic acid are also produced by saccahrolytic fermentation.[8] Acetic acid is used by muscle, propionic acid helps the liver produce ATP, and butyric acid provides energy to gut cells and may prevent cancer.[7]
Another, less favorable type of fermentation, proteolytic fermentation, breaks down proteins like enzymes, dead host and bacterial cells, and collagen and elastin found in food, and can produce toxins and carcinogens in addition to SCFAs. Thus a diet lower in protein lowers exposure to toxins.[2][6]
Evidence also suggests that bacteria enhance the absorption and storage of lipids.[3] Bacteria also produce and help the body absorb needed vitamins like vitamin K. In addition, the SCFAs they produce help the body absorb nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, and iron.[2]

Another benefit of SCFAs is that they increase growth of intestinal epithelial cells and control their proliferation and differentiation.[2] They may also cause lymphoid tissue near the gut to grow. Bacterial cells also alter intestinal growth by changing the expression of cell surface proteins such as sodium/glucose transporters.[3] In addition, changes they make to cells may prevent injury to the gut mucosa from occurring.[21]

Another important role of helpful gut flora is that they prevent species that would harm the host from colonizing the gut; an activity termed the "barrier effect". Yeasts and harmful bacterial species such as Clostridium difficile (the overgrowth of which can cause pseudomembranous colitis) are unable to grow too much due to competition from helpful gut flora species to adhere to the mucosal lining of the intestine, thus animals without gut flora are infected very easily. The barrier effect protects humans from both invading species and species normally present in the gut at low numbers, whose growth is usually inhibited by the gut flora.[2]
Helpful bacteria prevent the growth of pathogenic species by competing for nutrition and attachment sites to the epithelium of the colon. Symbiotic bacteria are more at home in this ecological niche and are thus more successful in the competition. The indigenous bacteria send chemical signals to the host about the amount of nutrients they need, and the host provides only that much, so harmful bacteria are starved out. Indigenous gut floras also produce bacteriocins which are proteinacious toxins that inhibit growth of similar bacterial strains, substances which kill harmful microbes and the levels of which can be regulated by enzymes produced by the host.[2]
The process of fermentation, since it produces fatty acids, also serves to lower the pH in the colon, preventing the proliferation of harmful species of bacteria and facilitating that of helpful species. The pH may also enhance the excretion of carcinogens.[7] Lactic bacteria such as Acidophilus and Bifidiobacterium, have a specific property of transforming sugars into lactic acid and acetic acid which will carry out the same job as fermentation; decrease the pH of the intestine and produce substances that suppress harmful bacteria.

Gut flora have a continuous and dynamic effect on the host's gut and systemic immune systems. The bacteria are key in promoting the early development of the gut's mucosal immune system both in terms of its physical components and function and continue to play a role later in life in its operation. The bacteria stimulate the lymphoid tissue associated with the gut mucosa to produce antibodies to pathogens. The immune system recognizes and fights harmful bacteria, but leaves the helpful species alone, a tolerance developed in infancy.[2][11][4][6]
As soon as an infant is born, bacteria begin colonizing its digestive tract. The first bacteria to settle in are able to affect the immune response, making it more favorable to their own survival and less so to competing species; thus the first bacteria to colonize the gut are important in determining the person's lifelong gut flora makeup. However, there is a shift at the time of weaning from predominantly facultative aerobic species such as Streptococci and Escherichia coli to mostly obligate anaerobic species.[2][3]
Recent findings have shown that gut bacteria play a role in the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the intestines, molecules that help the host repair damage due to injury. TLRs cause parts of the immune system to repair injury caused for example by radiation.[3][21] TLRs are one of the two pattern recognition receptors (PRR) that provide the intestine the ability to di
