Knut (polar bear)
Knut ( [knuÀêt] (help¬∑info)) (born 5 December 2006) is a polar bear who was born in captivity at the Zoologischer Garten Berlin. Rejected by his mother at birth, he was subsequently raised by zookeepers. He was the first polar bear cub to survive past infancy at the Berlin Zoo in more than thirty years. At one time the subject of international controversy, he became a popular tourist attraction and commercial success.[1] After the German tabloid newspaper Bild ran a quote from an animal rights activist that seemingly called for the death of the young cub, a worldwide public outrage was caused as fans rallied in support of his being hand-raised by humans. Children protested outside the zoo, and many e-mails and letters expressing sympathy for the cub's life were sent from around the world.[2]
Knut became the center of a mass media phenomenon dubbed "Knutmania" that spanned the globe and quickly spawned numerous toys, media specials, DVDs, and books.[3] Because of this, the cub was largely responsible for a significant increase in revenue, estimated at about five million euros, at the Berlin Zoo in 2007.[4] Zoo attendance figures for the year increased by an estimated 30 percent making it the most profitable year in its 163-year history.[5]


Knut was born at the Berlin Zoo to 20-year-old Tosca, a former circus performer from East Germany who was born in Canada, and her 13-year-old mate Lars, who was originally from the Tierpark Hellabrunn in Munich. After an unproblematic gestation time, Knut and his unnamed brother were born on 5 December 2006. Tosca rejected her cubs for unknown reasons, abandoning them on a rock in the polar bear enclosure.[6] Zoo keepers rescued the cubs by scooping them out of the enclosure with an extended fishing net,[6] but Knut's brother died of an infection four days later. Knut was the first polar bear to have been born and survive in the Berlin Zoo in over thirty years. Only the size of a guinea pig, he spent the first 44 days of his life in an incubator before zoo keeper Thomas D√∂rflein began raising the cub.[7]
Knut's need for round-the-clock care required that D√∂rflein not only sleep on a mattress next to Knut's sleeping crate at night, but also play with, bathe, and feed the cub daily. Knut's diet began with a bottle of baby formula mixed with cod liver oil every two hours, before graduating at the age of four months to a milk porridge mixed with cat food and vitamins.[8][9] D√∂rflein also accompanied Knut on his twice-daily one-hour shows for the public and therefore appeared in many videos and photographs alongside the cub. As a result, D√∂rflein became a minor celebrity in Germany[8] and was awarded Berlin's Medal of Merit in honor of his continuous care for the cub.[10] D√∂rflein died of a heart attack on 22 September 2008. He was 44 years old.[11]

In early March 2007, German tabloid Bild-Zeitung carried a quote by animal rights activist Frank Albrecht who said that Knut should have been killed rather than humiliated by being raised "as a domestic pet". He declared that the zoo was violating animal protection legislation by keeping him alive.[12] Wolfram Graf-Rudolf, the director of the Aachen Zoo, agreed with Albrecht and stated that the zookeepers "should have had the courage to let the bear die" after it was rejected, arguing that the bear will "die a little" every time it is separated from its caretaker.[13] A group of children protested at the zoo, holding up placards reading "Knut Must Live" and "We Love Knut", and others sent numerous emails and letters asking for the cub's life to be spared. Threatening letters were also sent to Albrecht.[2] The Berlin Zoo rallied in support of the baby polar bear, vowing not to harm him and rejecting the suggestion that it would be kinder to euthanise him.[13]
Albrecht, who was not associated with any particular animal rights organization, later claimed that he was quoted out of context: According to Albrecht, he had filed suit against the head of the Leipzig Zoo in December 2006, for killing a sloth bear cub rejected by its mother. The case was dismissed by the courts arguing that raising the animal by humans would have been inappropriate. Albrecht, who opposed that judgment, says he called for Knut's death not because he actually wanted to have the bear killed, but merely to call attention to the Leipzig decision, which would have granted the Berlin Zoo the right to kill the polar bear cub.[14] The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.[15][16]

On 23 March 2007, Knut was presented to the public for the first time.[17] Around 400 journalists visited the Berlin Zoo on what was dubbed "Knut Day" to report on the cub's first public appearance to a worldwide audience.[18] Because Knut became the focus of worldwide media at a very young age, many stories and false alarms regarding the cub's health and well-being were circulated during his first year. For example, on 16 April 2007, Knut was removed from display due to teething pains resulting from the growth of his right upper canine tooth, but initial reports vaguely stated that he was suffering from an unknown illness and subsequently put on antibiotics.[19] Much ado was also made about a death threat that was sent shortly before 15:00 local time on Wednesday 18 April 2007. The zoo had received an anonymous letter by fax which said "Knut ist tot! Donnerstag Mittag." ("Knut is dead! Thursday noon.")[20] In response, the police increased their security measures around the bear. The time frame for the threat passed without incident or harm to Knut.[21][22]
Despite Der Spiegel reporting on 30 April 2007 that Knut was "steadily getting less cute" as he increased in age,[23] Knut continued to bring in record crowds to the zoo that summer. After reaching seven months old and 50†kg (110†lb) in July 2007, Knut's scheduled twice daily public appearances were canceled due to the zoo's concern for the safety of his keeper. Zoo spokeswoman Regine Damm also said it was time for the bear to "associate with other bears and not with other people."[24] After living in the same enclosure as Ernst, a Malaysian black bear cub who was born a month before Knut, and its mother,[25] Knut was then moved to his own private living space. While visitor numbers dwindled from extreme highs in March and April, Knut remained a major attraction at the zoo for the rest of 2007. 400,000 guests were recorded in August 2007, which was an all time high.[26]
News of Knut and his life at the zoo was still being reported internationally in late 2007. Knut's restricted diet, necessary to curtail his natural weight gain necessary to survive harsh winters, made headlines outside of Germany.[27] His daily meals were reduced in number from four to three, and treats, such as croissants, which are favored by the young polar bear, were restricted.[28] After hurting his foot while slipping on a wet rock in his enclosure a month later in September, there was an outpouring of concern and support from fans worldwide.[29]

In November 2007 and weighing over 90†kg (200†lb), Knut was deemed too dangerous for close handling and his interaction with human handlers was further diminished. The celebration of the cub's first birthday, which was attended by hundreds of children, was broadcast live on German television. The national mint also issued 25,000 special commemorative silver coins to mark his birthday.[30] Knut's future role at the Berlin Zoo may include his becoming an "attractive stud" for other zoos in order to help preserve his species.[31] When Flocke was born at the Nuremberg Zoo in December 2007 under similar circumstances, Bild dubbed her Mrs. Knut, suggesting that the two German-born polar bears might become mates when they mature.[32] Before he matures at the age of three or four, the common age for bears to become sexually active, Knut will likely be moved to another zoo with more mates closer to his age.
Although still considered a cub, Knut weighed more than 130†kg (300†lb) a year after his public debut. A plate of six-inch glass, strong enough to resist a mortar blast, stands between him and zoo visitors.[33] At the end of March 2008, Markus R√∂bke, one of the keepers who helped rear Knut, reported that the bear should leave the zoo as soon as possible in order to help him acclimate to a life alone.[34] R√∂bke also said that Knut plainly misses his past father-figure, Thomas D√∂rflein, and has become so used to attention that he cries when no one is near his enclosure. "Knut needs an audience," R√∂bke stated. "That has to change".[34] In April, animal welfare campaigners criticized the zoo for allowing Knut to kill and eat ten carp from the moat surrounding his enclosure, saying that it was a breach of German animal protection regulations. The zoo's bear expert, Heiner Kl√∂s, however, said that Knut's behavior was "all part of being a polar bear."[35]
In July 2008, it was announced that the Neum√ºnster Zoo in northern Germany, which owns Knut's father, was suing the Berlin Zoo for the profits from Knut's success.[36] Although the Berlin Zoo conceded Neum√ºnster's ownership of Knut due to a previous agreement, it has contended that the other zoo has no right to its proceeds. Neum√ºnster had previously tried to negotiate with Berlin Zoo, but is now seeking a court ruling in their favor. Peter Dr√ºwa, the zoo director at Neum√ºnster, stated that they "do not want to remove Knut from his environment, but we have a right to our request for money."[37] Shortly before Knut's second birthday, reports began circulating that the bear would have to be relocated to another zoo because he was becoming too large for his enclosure. The zoo has since release statements that they wish to keep Knut, and the mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit, has also declared he wants the still-adolescent cub to stay in the capital.[38]


The Berlin Zoo registered Knut as a trademark in late March 2007. As a result, its shares more than doubled at the Berlin Stock Exchange; previously worth around 2,000 euros, the value closed at 4,820 euros just a week later.[39] The zoo reported that its attendance figures for 2007 increased by an estimated 30 percent, making it the most profitable it had been in its 163 year history.[5] Knut earned the Berlin Zoo nearly five million euros that year, mainly thanks to an increase in visitors as well as the amount of merchandise sold.[4]
Various companies profited from the attention surrounding Knut by developing themed products such as ringtones and cuddly toys.[40] Famed plush toy company Steiff produced several Knut-based plush toys in three sizes and models: sitting, standing, and lying down. The first 2,400 produced toys, which sold exclusively at the Berlin Zoo, sold out in only four days.[5] The money raised from the Steiff deal was intended to be used to renovate the polar bear enclosure at the zoo.[41] Candy company Haribo released a raspberry-flavored gummy bear sweet called Cuddly Knut beginning in April 2007. They pledged to donate ten euro cents to the zoo for every tub of Knut sweets it sold. The gummy bears sold so well that the Bonn-based company had to expand production to a second factory to deal with demands.[42]
Knut has been the subject of several popular songs in Germany, the most successful of which were the singles "Knut is Cute" and "Knut, der kleine Eisb√§r" (English: ‚ÄúKnut, the little polar bear‚Äù) by nine-year-old Kitty from K√∂penick.[43][44] In Britain, musical comedian Mitch Benn has performed three songs about Knut for BBC Radio 4 satirical series The Now Show: "The Baby Bear Must DIE!",[45] "Knut Isn't Cute Anymore",[46] and "Goodbye Knut"‚Äî a power ballad about Knut moving to Neum√ºnster Zoo.[47] A blog with updates about the polar bear is maintained by a journalist at the regional public broadcaster Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg; it is available in German, English, and Spanish. RBB is also responsible for a weekly television program dedicated to the polar bear cub that is broadcast in Germany. Knut has also been the subject of several DVDs,[48] including one entitled "Knut - Stories from a Polar Bear's Nursery". He appeared on the 29 March 2007 cover of the German Vanity Fair magazine, which included a several page spread about the cub's life.[39]
On 1 May 2007 it was announced that New York-based Turtle Pond Publications and the Berlin Zoo had signed a deal for the worldwide publishing rights to Knut with the hopes of raising awareness of global warming issues. Written by Craig Hatkoff and his daughters Juliana and Isabella, the 44-page book entitled Knut, der kleine Eisb√§renjunge (Little Polar Bear Knut) includes Knut's life story as well as previously unpublished photographs.[49] Although several books about Knut had already been published in Germany, this book was the first to be authorized by the Berlin Zoo.
The book was published in Germany by Ravensburger on 26 July 2007 and US publishing company Scholastic released the English version, entitled Knut: How one little polar bear captivated the world, in the United States in November of the same year.[50][3] Rights to the book have also been sold to publishers in Japan, England, Mexico, China, and Italy.
On 31 December 2007, the zoo's director confirmed the zoo had received a proposal for a film deal from Hollywood film producer Ash R. Shah, whose films include Supernova and Shark Bait, to make an animated film about the bear's life.[51] Shah reportedly approached the Berlin Zoo with a purported ‚Ç¨3.5 million film deal.[52] Knut made his big screen debut in the German film Knut und seine Freunde (Knut and His Friends), which premiered in Berlin on 2 March 2008.[53] Directed by Michael Johnson, the film depicts how Knut was rescued after his mother abandoned him and also features a polar bear family from the Arctic and two brown bear cubs from Belarus.[51]

Dr. Gerald Uhlich, of the Berlin zoo's board of trustees, stated that because of his vast popularity, Knut has become a means of communication and that he has the ability to "draw attention to the environment in a nice way. Not in a threatening, scolding way."[54] As a result, the German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel officially adopted Knut as the mascot for a conference on endangered species to be held in Bonn in 2008.[54] The minister met with Knut soon after his zoo debut, commenting that although Knut was in safe hands, "worldwide polar bears are in danger and if Knut can help the cause, then that is a good thing."[17]
Photographer Annie Leibovitz took pictures of Knut that were used for an environmental campaign, including Vanity Fair magazine's May 2007 Green Issue in which he was superimposed into a photograph with American actor Leonardo DiCaprio.[55] The polar bear has also been depicted on the logo for the German Environment Minister's campaign against global warming[30] and a 2008 special issue stamp. Officially released on April 9, the stamp shows the roughly one-year-old Knut with the slogan "Natur weltweit bewahren" ("Preserve nature worldwide").[4]
