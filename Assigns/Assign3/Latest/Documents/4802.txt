List of countries by life expectancy
This is a list of countries by life expectancy at birth, the average number of years to be lived by a group of people born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains constant in the future. The entry includes total population as well as the male and female components. Several non-sovereign entities are also included in this list. This list does not directly reflect the quality of healthcare of the countries listed. Figures are from the 2008 CIA World Factbook[1] and from the 2006 revision of the United Nations World Population Prospects report, for the period 2005-2010 [2]. Only countries/territories with a population of 100,000 or more in 2007 are included in the United Nations list.
The life expectancy (both sexes, at birth) of the world is 66.26 years (64.3 years for males and 68.35 years for females) for 2008 according to CIA World Factbook 2008 and 67.2 years (65.0 years for males and 69.5 years for females) for 2005-2010 according to United Nations World Population Prospects 2006. Life expectancy ranges from 84.33 years in Macau to 31.99 years in Swaziland. Many of the countries with the lowest life expectancies, namely Swaziland, Botswana, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia, Zambia, Malawi, Central African Republic, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, are suffering from very high rates of HIV/AIDS infection, with adult prevalence rates ranging from 10 to 38.8 percent [3]. Also note that in countries with high infant mortality rates, the life expectancy at birth will be lower and may not reflect the life expectancy a person who has survived his/her first year of life would have.
