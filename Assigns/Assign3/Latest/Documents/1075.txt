ID3 algorithm
ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) is an algorithm used to generate a decision tree invented by Ross Quinlan.[1]
The algorithm is based on Occam's razor: it prefers smaller decision trees (simpler theories) over larger ones. However, it does not always produce the smallest tree, and is therefore a heuristic. Occam's razor is formalized using the concept of information entropy:
The ID3 algorithm can be summarized as follows:
An explanation of the implementation of ID3 can be found at C4.5 algorithm, which is an extended version of ID3.

The actual algorithm is as follows:
