PostSecret
PostSecret is an ongoing community mail art project, created by Frank Warren, in which people mail their secrets anonymously on one side of a homemade postcard. Select secrets are then posted on the PostSecret website, or used for PostSecret's books or museum exhibits.

The simple concept of the project was that completely anonymous people decorate a postcard and portray a secret that they had never previously revealed. No restrictions are made on the content of the secret; only that it must be completely truthful and must never have been spoken before. Entries range from admissions of sexual misconduct and criminal activity to confessions of secret desires, embarrassing habits, hopes and dreams.
Since Frank Warren created the website on January 1, 2005, PostSecret has collected and displayed upwards of 2,500 original pieces of art from people across the United States and around the world.
The site, which started as an experiment on Blogspot, was updated every Sunday with 10 new secrets, all of which share a relatively constant style, giving the "artists" who participate some guidelines on how their secrets should be represented. It recently began posting approximately 20 new pieces each Sunday after a week where Frank Warren mysteriously did not post any new secrets for one week.
From June 24 to July 3, 2007, the "Comments" section of the site was enabled. While a comments feature is frequently present on blogs, it had been previously absent from the PostSecret site. Many visitors viewed the presence of a comments section as out of character for the site, which was previously distinguished as a non-judgmental space for participants to reveal personal secrets. Many visitors felt that the new section contradicted the purpose of the site, as evidenced in numerous comments criticizing a postcard in which the author claims to have fed bleach to his/her cat.
In October 2007, the PostSecret Community was launched (www.postsecretcommunity.com). Since its inception, more than 39,000 people have registered for the online discussion forum. Questions have been raised about how the forum affects the anonymity of the PostSecret project, but for those involved on the Community board, there seems to be a positive response of people who haven't sent in a postcard or haven't seen their secret on the site sharing their secrets with other PostSecret fans.
According to Youth Trends' February 2008 "Top Ten List Report" PostSecret was the 10th most popular site amongst female students in the USA, with 7% of those polled naming the site as their favorite. [1]
Frank Warren is currently hosting events at numerous colleges to speak about the many different secrets of today's society. An art exhibition--also currently traveling the country--showcases many of the hundreds of thousands of secrets Warren has received.
The site encourages others to create and send in your postcards; Postcards to be sent into PostSecret are addressed to:
Post Secret

Germantown, Maryland 20874

The site was not updated on the Sunday of July 1, 2007 while the address and instructions for visitors to send in their secrets was removed. Also notable was the deletion of a long-visible post — which contained contact information for Hopeline, a suicide hotline the site previously supported, and the story and picture of "Casie", a young woman who fought depression and found help through the site.
On Sunday, July 8, 2007, PostSecret was updated as normal, with the address and instructions for users wanting to mail in their secrets, as well as the Hopeline and "Casie" posts, all reinstated. Also included on the page for one week was a rare message from Frank explaining the recent events, confirming the comments section would stay unavailable and stating that he had needed a break from the project for a week, but that he hoped to go another 130 weeks before he took another.
However, Sunday, August 12, 2007 constituted a break of sorts. In lieu of posting standard secrets, Frank posted the link to a video he had uploaded to YouTube [2] entitled "New PostSecret Mini-Movie", expressing his feelings about the project and promising that the next week would bring more secrets [3]
Frank took another break Sunday, December 28, 2008.

On Sunday, September 16, 2007, the traditional PostSecret blog was gone. In its place was a new blogger site belonging to someone named "Nicole". It was suddenly and mistakenly shut down as Blogger thought the PostSecret blog was a 'spam blog'. This error was fixed and Frank's site was put back up with the secrets from September 9th. A few hours later, just minutes before noon EST, the website was pulled down again, this time displaying a Blogger error message. Shortly after noon EST, with the site having been restored, Frank posted an explanation (see right). Not long thereafter, that day's secrets were posted as normal. 
On February 24, 2008, Frank posted multiple e-mail comments from viewers that attacked various secrets posted that week--notably: one from a parent insulting a teacher, one from a call operator insulting a relative of a soldier, and one from a would-be mother insulting a woman desperate not to get pregnant. This revitalized previous discussions on whether or not commenting should be allowed at all on the secrets, as while the drama of disagreement makes the site more interesting, it can sometimes lead to others passing judgment on the posters without granting them the opportunity to defend themselves. However, no action was taken, and the blog continued as normal the next week.

The website does not provide any way to go through archives and view old posts but by downloading the RSS feed, one can go back through previous secrets.
However, the postsecret community on Livejournal enables you to scroll back through previous journal entries to view older posts from postsecret's Sunday Secrets collection. This can only be done by searching directly through postsecret's Livejournal page, and only allows you to view the last 4 entries, as viewing of any posts older than this has been disabled.
On Sunday, July 27, the website provided the previous week's secrets at the bottom of the new updated page under the heading "Last Weeks Secrets." Frank will usually keep last week's secrets up for only a few hours or days.

The project has received some national news coverage, being featured weekly in Washington, D.C.'s City Paper as well as in the All-American Rejects 2005 music video Dirty Little Secret. Artwork from the site was blown up to poster size and used as the background for the shoot.
The blown up poster size PostSecrets along with thousands of regular size PostSecrets were then featured in an exhibition with the Washington Project for the Arts.
In the sixth annual Weblog Awards, the PostSecret website received five Bloggies in 2006: Best American Weblog, Best Topical Weblog, Best Community Weblog, Best New Weblog, and Weblog of the Year.
In the seventh annual Weblog Awards, the PostSecret website received Weblog of the Year for 2007.
Lyxzen Suicide shot a set for Suicide Girls entitled "Post Secret" which featured her creating post cards that were seemingly supposed to be sent in to Post Secret while undressing.

Selected postcards, including some not on the website, were published in PostSecret: Extraordinary Confessions from Ordinary Lives (ISBN 0-06-089919-0). It was published by Harper Collins/Regan Books and released on December 1, 2005.
A second PostSecret book, My Secret: A PostSecret Book (ISBN 0-06-119668-1), was released on October 24, 2006. It is also published by Regan Books.
A third PostSecret book, The Secret Lives of Men and Women: A PostSecret Book (ISBN 0-06-119875-7), was released on January 9, 2007.
A fourth PostSecret book, A Lifetime of Secrets: A PostSecret Book (ISBN 0-06-123860-0), was released on October 9, 2007.
An upcoming fifth PostSecret book, Confessions on Life, Death, & God, will be released in 2009.
Instead of sending in their secrets, many people take their postcards to a bookstore and discreetly hide them between the pages of a PostSecret book. This spin-off activity means that the eventual purchaser of the book gets an unexpected secret to keep.[citation needed]
Frank Warren has stated that he includes a secret of his own in each of the PostSecret books.[citation needed]

With permission from Frank Warren, a French version of PostSecret was launched in October 2007 under the name PostSecretFrance and in February 2008, a German version was started as PostSecret auf Deutsch. There is also one in Spanish called Los Secretos Dominicales and now a Chinese version 邮寄你的秘密 PostSecretChina. The Chinese blog is not officially affiliated with PostSecret.

The 1973 book Variable Piece 4: Secrets by the conceptual artist Douglas Huebler (one of many works in his Variable Piece series) was a compilation of nearly 1800 secrets written down by random people.
