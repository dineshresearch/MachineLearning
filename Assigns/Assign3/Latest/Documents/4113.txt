NEWS
NEWS (ニュース ,Nyūsu?), is a six-member Japanese musical group consisting of Tomohisa Yamashita, Ryo Nishikido, Keiichiro Koyama, Takahisa Masuda, Shigeaki Kato, and Yuya Tegoshi. The group's name is an acronym based on the cardinal directions (North, East, West, South) and the members locations.[1] Formed in 2003 by Johnny Kitagawa as a nine member group under the label Johnny's Entertainment, NEWS released a promotional single NEWS Nippon (NEWS ニッポン ,NEWS Japan?), which was used for the World Cup of Volleyball Championships. In 2004, Takahiro Moriuchi (森内寛貴 ,Moriuchi Takahiro?) left the group and the remaining eight members released their debut single, "Kibō: Yell" (希望 ~Yell~ ,Hope ~Yell~?), which debuted atop the Oricon charts.
In 2006, the group released their fifth consecutive number-one single, "Sayaendō/Hadashi no Cinderella Boy" (サヤエンドウ/裸足のシンデレラボーイ ,Peas/Barefoot Cinderella Boy?), as the current six-member group due to the controversy surrounding then-members Hiroki Uchi and Hironori Kusano.[2] After a brief hiatus, they released their seventh number-one single, "Hoshi o Mezashite" (星をめざして ,lit. Aim for the Stars?). In 2008, they released their tenth single, Happy Birthday, which made NEWS the second Japanese group after label-mates KinKi Kids to have ten consecutive number-one singles since their debut.[3]


Formed in September 2003, NEWS released a promotional single, "NEWS Nippon" (NEWS ニッポン ,NEWS Japan?), which was used as the theme song for the World Cup of Volleyball Championships.[1][4] Before holding their first concert, NEWSnow Concert: NEWS' Concert (NEWSnowCONCERT〜ニュースのコンサート〜 ?), Takahiro Moriuchi left the group. NEWS later released their debut single, "Kibō: Yell", which topped the Oricon chart.[5] Their next two singles, "Akaku Moyuru Taiyō" (紅く燃ゆる太陽 ,Burning Red Sun?) (2004) and Cherish (チェリッシュ ,Cherisshu?) (2005), both debuted atop the charts, as did NEWS' first album, Touch, which sold 164,016 copies in its first week.[6][7][8]
In July 2005, Hiroki Uchi was scrutinized for underage drinking and was suspended indefinitely from both NEWS and Kanjani Eight, another group he was a part of.[9][10] Despite having lost a member, NEWS released their fourth single, "Teppen" (てっぺん ,Top?), which like its predecessors debut at number-one.[11] In January 2006, NEWS was reduced to six members when Hironori Kusano was suspended indefinitely for the same charge as Uchi.[2][10] NEWS released their fifth single, "Sayaendō/Hadashi no Cinderella Boy" (サヤエンドウ/裸足のシンデレラボーイ ,Peas/Barefoot Cinderella Boy?) (March 2006), which was their fifth consecutive number-one single.[12] On May 1, 2006, after NEWS finished their "NEWS Spring Tour", the group went on hiatus.[10][13]

On December 30, 2006, it was announced that NEWS would make their return at Johnny's Concert Countdown 2006-2007 as a six-member group, since Hiroki Uchi and Hironori Kusano had been demoted to trainees.[4][10][14] To mark their return, NEWS embarked on a tour and released their sixth single "Hoshi o Mezashite" (星をめざして ,Aim For the Stars?).[15] "Hoshi o Mezashite" became their sixth number-one single, which went on to be used as the theme song for the Japanese version of Happy Feet.[16][15]
On November 7, NEWS simultaneously released their seventh single, "Weeeek" and their second album, Pacific. Both releases debut atop of their respective charts with "Weeeek" selling 263,000 copies in its first week and Pacific selling 196,000 copies in their first week. This marked the tenth in in Oricon history that an artist had both their single and album debut atop the charts simultaneously.[17] To further support their album, NEWS went on a nationwide tour, NEWS Concert Tour Pacific 2007-2008, from December 15, 2007 to January 27, 2008. Because tickets were in such high demand, two more dates were added to the concert, which resulted in NEWS performing at the Tokyo Dome for the first time.[18]
In February 2008 NEWS released their eighth number-one single, "Taiyō no Namida" (太陽のナミダ ,Tears of the Sun?), which was used as the theme song for the movie Kurosagi, starring Tomohisa Yamashita.[19] NEWS released two more number-one singles, "Summer Time" (May 2008) and "Happy Birthday" (October 2008), before releasing their third studio album Color (November 2008).[20] The release of "Happy Birthday" made NEWS the second group, after the KinKi Kids, to have ten consecutive number-one singles since their debut.[3] Color debuted at the number-one position on the charts, giving NEWS their third consecutive album.[21] NEWS will be releasing their new single, "Koi no ABO" (恋のABO ,Love's ABO?) on April 29, 2009.
