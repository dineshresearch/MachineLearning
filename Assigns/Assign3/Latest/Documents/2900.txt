Jamie Livingston
Jamie Livingston (October 25, 1956 - October 25, 1997) was a New York-based photographer, film-maker and circus performer. Between March 31, 1979 and October 25, 1997, the day of his death, he took a single picture nearly every day with a Polaroid camera. [1][2]
Livingston's 'Polaroid a Day' photographic diary started at Bard College and though some photos have gone missing from the collection, 6,697 Polaroids remain. The collection, dated in sequence, has been organized by his friends Hugh Crawford and Betsy Reid into an exhibit at the Bertelsmann Campus Center at Bard College called "JAMIE LIVINGSTON. PHOTO OF THE DAY: 1979-1997", which opened in 2007.[3]

Livingston was a member of the musical, percussionist circus troupe Janus Circus from Bard College. He also worked as a cinematographer and editor of music videos for MTV, as well as working on advertisements with Nike. [4]
In 1979, Livingston received a Polaroid camera and after a few weeks noticed that he was taking about one photo a day, which subsequently evolved into the project.[5]
Livingston's Polaroid a Day charted his experiences with cancer, and his subsequent engagement and marriage. His photographs in and out of hospital continued up until the day of his death.[6]
