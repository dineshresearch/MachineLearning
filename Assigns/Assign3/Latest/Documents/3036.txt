Prime number
In mathematics, a prime number (or a prime) is a natural number which has exactly two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself. An infinitude of prime numbers exists, as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC. The first twenty-five prime numbers are:
See the list of prime numbers for a longer list. The number 1 is by definition not a prime number. The set of prime numbers is sometimes denoted by .
The property of being a prime is called primality, and the word prime is also used as an adjective. Since 2 is the only even prime number, the term odd prime refers to any prime number greater than 2.
The study of prime numbers is part of number theory. Prime numbers have been the subject of intense research, yet some fundamental questions, such as the Riemann hypothesis and the Goldbach conjecture, have been unresolved for more than a century. The problem of modelling the distribution of prime numbers is a popular subject of investigation for number theorists: when looking at individual numbers, the primes seem to be randomly distributed, but the ‚Äúglobal‚Äù distribution of primes follows well-defined laws.
The notion of prime number has been generalized in many different branches of mathematics:

A natural number is called a prime, a prime number or just prime if it has exactly two distinct divisors. Otherwise it is called composite. Therefore, 1 is not prime, since it has only one divisor, namely 1. However, 2 and 3 are prime, since they have exactly two divisors, namely 1 and 2, and 1 and 3, respectively. Next, 4, is composite, since it has 3 divisors: 1, 2, and 4.
Using symbols, a number n > 1 is prime if it cannot be written as a product of two factors a and b, both of which are bigger than 1:
The crucial importance of prime numbers to number theory and mathematics in general stems from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic which states that every positive integer larger than 1 can be written as a product of one or more primes in a way which is unique except possibly for the order of the prime factors. Primes can thus be considered the ‚Äúbasic building blocks‚Äù of the natural numbers. For example, we can write
As in this example, the same prime factor may occur multiple times. A decomposition
of a number n into (finitely many) prime factors p1, p2, ... to pt is called prime factorization of n. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic can be rephrased so as to say that any factorization into primes will be identical except for the order of the factors. So, albeit there are many prime factorization algorithms to do this in practice for larger numbers, they all have to yield the same result.

The image at the right shows a graphical way to show that 12 is not prime. More generally, all prime numbers except 2 and 5, written in the usual decimal system, end in 1, 3, 7 or 9, since numbers ending in 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8 are multiples of 2 and numbers ending in 0 or 5 are multiples of 5. Similarly, all prime numbers above 3 are of the form 6n†‚àí†1 or 6n†+†1, because all other numbers are divisible by 2 or 3. Generalizing this, all prime numbers above q are of form q#¬∑n†+†m, where 0 < m < q, and m has no prime factor ‚â§†q.
If p is a prime number and p divides a product ab of integers, then p divides a or p divides b. This proposition is known as Euclid's lemma. It is used in some proofs of the uniqueness of prime factorizations.

The importance of this theorem is one of the reasons for the exclusion of 1 from the set of prime numbers. If 1 were admitted as a prime, the precise statement of the theorem would require additional qualifications, since 3 could then be decomposed in different ways
Until the 19th century, most mathematicians considered the number 1 a prime, with the definition being just that a prime is divisible only by 1 and itself but not requiring a specific number of distinct divisors. There is still a large body of mathematical work that is valid despite labelling 1 a prime, such as the work of Stern and Zeisel. Derrick Norman Lehmer's list of primes up to 10,006,721, reprinted as late as 1956,[1] started with 1 as its first prime.[2] Henri Lebesgue is said to be the last professional mathematician to call 1 prime.[citation needed] The change in label occurred so that the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, as stated, is valid, i.e., ‚Äúeach number has a unique factorization into primes.‚Äù[3][4] Furthermore, the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks, such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of Euler's totient function or the sum of divisors function.[5]

There are hints in the surviving records of the ancient Egyptians that they had some knowledge of prime numbers: the Egyptian fraction expansions in the Rhind papyrus, for instance, have quite different forms for primes and for composites. However, the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from the Ancient Greeks. Euclid's Elements (circa 300 BC) contain important theorems about primes, including the infinitude of primes and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Euclid also showed how to construct a perfect number from a Mersenne prime. The Sieve of Eratosthenes, attributed to Eratosthenes, is a simple method to compute primes, although the large primes found today with computers are not generated this way.
After the Greeks, little happened with the study of prime numbers until the 17th century. In 1640 Pierre de Fermat stated (without proof) Fermat's little theorem (later proved by Leibniz and Euler). A special case of Fermat's theorem may have been known much earlier by the Chinese. Fermat conjectured that all numbers of the form 22n†+†1 are prime (they are called Fermat numbers) and he verified this up to n = 4 (or 216†+†1). However, the very next Fermat number 232†+†1 is composite (one of its prime factors is 641), as Euler discovered later, and in fact no further Fermat numbers are known to be prime. The French monk Marin Mersenne looked at primes of the form 2p†‚àí†1, with p a prime. They are called Mersenne primes in his honor.
Euler's work in number theory included many results about primes. He showed the infinite series 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 + 1/11 + ‚Ä¶ is divergent. In 1747 he showed that the even perfect numbers are precisely the integers of the form 2p‚àí1(2p†‚àí†1), where the second factor is a Mersenne prime.
At the start of the 19th century, Legendre and Gauss independently conjectured that as x tends to infinity, the number of primes up to x is asymptotic to x/ln(x), where ln(x) is the natural logarithm of x. Ideas of Riemann in his 1859 paper on the zeta-function sketched a program which would lead to a proof of the prime number theorem. This outline was completed by Hadamard and de la Vall√©e Poussin, who independently proved the prime number theorem in 1896.
Proving a number is prime is not done (for large numbers) by trial division. Many mathematicians have worked on primality tests for large numbers, often restricted to specific number forms. This includes P√©pin's test for Fermat numbers (1877), Proth's theorem (around 1878), the Lucas‚ÄìLehmer test for Mersenne numbers (originated 1856),[6] and the generalized Lucas‚ÄìLehmer test. More recent algorithms like APRT-CL, ECPP and AKS work on arbitrary numbers but remain much slower.
For a long time, prime numbers were thought to have extremely limited application outside of pure mathematics;[citation needed] this changed in the 1970s when the concepts of public-key cryptography were invented, in which prime numbers formed the basis of the first algorithms such as the RSA cryptosystem algorithm.
Since 1951 all the largest known primes have been found by computers. The search for ever larger primes has generated interest outside mathematical circles. The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search and other distributed computing projects to find large primes have become popular in the last ten to fifteen years, while mathematicians continue to struggle with the theory of primes.

Modular arithmetic is a modification of usual arithmetic, by doing all calculations "modulo" a fixed number n. All calculations of modular arithmetic take place in the finite set
Calculating modulo n means that sums, differences and products are calculated as usual, but then only the remainder after division by n is considered. For example, let n = 7. Then, in modular arithmetic modulo 7, the sum 3 + 5 is 1 instead of 8, since 8 divided by 7 has remainder 1. Similarly, 6 + 1 = 0 modulo 7, 2 ‚àí 5 = 4 modulo 7 (since ‚àí3 + 7 = 4) and 3 ¬∑ 4 = 5 modulo 7 (12 has remainder 5). The set {0, 1, 2, ..., n ‚àí 1}, with this modified addition and multiplication is denoted Z/nZ for all n. Standard properties of addition and multiplication familiar from the number system of the integers or rational numbers remain valid, for example
(In the parlance of abstract algebra, Z/nZ is a ring.) In general it is, however not possible to divide in this setting. For example, for n = 6, the equation
a solution x of which would be an analogue of 2/3, cannot be solved, as one can see by calculating 3 ¬∑ 0, ..., 3 ¬∑ 5 modulo 6.
The distinctive feature of prime numbers is the following: division is possible in modular arithmetic if and only if n is a prime. For n = 7, the equation
has a unique solution, x = 3. In abstract algebra, Z/pZ is called a finite field. Equivalently, n is prime if and only if all integers m satisfying 2 ‚â§ m ‚â§ n ‚àí 1 are coprime to n, i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1. Using Euler's totient function, n is prime if and only if œÜ(n) = n ‚àí 1.
A number of theorems can be derived from inspecting Z/pZ in an abstract way, for any prime p. For example Fermat's little theorem: if a is any integer, then ap†‚àí†a is divisible by p. A consequence of this is the following: if p is a prime number other than 2 and 5, 1/p is always a recurring decimal, whose period is p ‚àí 1 or a divisor of p ‚àí 1. This can be deduced directly from Fermat's little theorem. 1/p expressed likewise in base q (rather than base 10) has similar effect, provided that p is not a prime factor of q. The article on recurring decimals shows some of the interesting properties. Wilson's theorem says that an integer p > 1 is prime if and only if the factorial (p†‚àí†1)! + 1 is divisible by p. Conversely, an integer n > 4 is composite if and only if (n†‚àí†1)! is divisible by n.


The oldest known proof for the statement that there are infinitely many prime numbers is given by the Greek mathematician Euclid in his Elements (Book IX, Proposition 20). Euclid states the result as "there are more than any given [finite] number of primes", and his proof is essentially the following:
Consider any finite set of primes. Multiply all of them together and add 1 (see Euclid number). The resulting number is not divisible by any of the primes in the finite set we considered, because dividing by any of these would give a remainder of 1. Because all non-prime numbers can be decomposed into a product of underlying primes, then either this resultant number is prime itself, or there is a prime number or prime numbers which the resultant number could be decomposed into but are not in the original finite set of primes. Either way, there is at least one more prime that was not in the finite set we started with. This argument applies no matter what finite set we began with. So there are more primes than any given finite number.
This previous argument explains why the product P of finitely many primes plus 1 must be divisible by some prime (possibly itself) not among those finitely many primes.
The proof is sometimes phrased in a way that falsely leads some readers to think that P†+†1 must itself be prime, and think that Euclid's proof says the prime product plus 1 is always prime. This confusion arises when the proof is presented as a proof by contradiction and P is assumed to be the product of the members of a finite set containing all primes. Then it is asserted that if P†+†1 is not divisible by any members of that set, then it is not divisible by any primes and "is therefore itself prime" (quoting G. H. Hardy[7]). This sometimes leads readers to conclude mistakenly that if P is the product of the first n primes then P†+†1 is prime. That conclusion relies on a hypothesis later proved false, and so cannot be considered proved. The smallest counterexample with composite P†+†1 is (2†√ó†3†√ó†5†√ó†7†√ó†11†√ó†13)†+†1 = 30,031 = 59†√ó†509 (both primes). See also Euclid's theorem.
Adding the reciprocals of all primes together results in a divergent infinite series (proof). More precisely, if S(x) denotes the sum of the reciprocals of all prime numbers p with p ‚â§ x, then S(x) = ln†ln†x†+†O(1) for x†‚Üí†‚àû. This was shown by Euler.
Another proof based on Fermat numbers was given by Goldbach.[8] Kummer's is particularly elegant[9] and Harry Furstenberg provides one using genera
