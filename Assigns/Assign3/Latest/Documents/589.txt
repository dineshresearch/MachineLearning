Music on The Sopranos
The role of music is an important one on the HBO television drama The Sopranos. The show has received considerable critical attention for its effective use of an eclectic array of previously recorded songs.[1][2][3][4] Series creator David Chase personally selects all of the show's music with the producer Martin Bruestle and music editor Kathryn Dayak, sometimes also consulting Steven Van Zandt, who, in addition to portraying Silvio Dante on the show, also serves as guitarist for Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band.[1] The music is often selected once the production and editing of an episode is completed, but on occasion sequences will be filmed to match preselected pieces of music.[5]
Stylistically, the music on the show can range from mainstream pop (Britney Spears, The Bangles) to '60s British rock (The Kinks, The Rolling Stones) to classic jazz and soul (Ella Fitzgerald, Ben E. King) to hip-hop (Xzibit, Time Zone), and more, often within the span of a single episode.[6]


The opening credits for each episode consists of Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) driving from New York City to his home in North Caldwell, New Jersey. The musical accompaniment for this segment is the "Chosen One Remix" of the song "Woke Up This Morning" by the British group Alabama 3 (known in the United States as A3 for legal reasons).

Each episode's closing credits sequence features a unique piece of previously recorded music, with few exceptions. The episode "A Hit Is a Hit" uses a song by the fictional band Defiler, which was featured earlier in the episode. Three episodes feature multiple songs in the credits sequence ("Commendatori," "Whitecaps" and "Cold Stones"), while two episodes ("Full Leather Jacket" and "Made in America") have no music at all, although the latter has music directly before the ending credits are displayed.
The following is a list of songs used at the end of each episode:







To date, there have been two official soundtrack compilations released in association with The Sopranos. The first, titled The Sopranos: Music from the HBO Original Series, was released in 1999, and contains selections from the show's first two seasons.[7] The second, titled The Sopranos: Peppers & Eggs: Music from the HBO Origina
