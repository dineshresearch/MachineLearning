Cuba
The Republic of Cuba (IPA: /ÀàkjuÀêb…ô/, Spanish:  Cuba (help¬∑info) or  Rep√∫blica de Cuba (help¬∑info) Spanish pronunciation: [reÀàpuŒ≤lika √∞e ÀàkuŒ≤a]) is an island country in the Caribbean. It consists of the island of Cuba, the Isla de la Juventud, and several archipelagos.
Havana is the largest city in Cuba and the country's capital. Santiago de Cuba is the second largest city.[9] Cuba is home to over 11 million people and is the most populous insular nation in the Caribbean. Its people, culture, and customs draw from diverse sources, including the aboriginal Ta√≠no and Ciboney peoples; the period of Spanish colonialism; the introduction of African slaves; and its proximity to the United States.

The name "Cuba" comes from the Ta√≠no language and though the exact meaning is unclear, it may be translated either as "where fertile land is abundant" (cubao),[10] or as "great place" (coabana).[11]

"Everyone dreamed of Cuba", wrote Cuban romanticist Miguel Barnet[12], as Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean at the confluence of the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Cuba is south of the eastern United States and The Bahamas, west of the Turks and Caicos Islands and Haiti, east of Mexico and north of the Cayman Islands and Jamaica.
Cuba's main island, at 766†miles (1,233†km) long, is the world's 17th largest.
Cuba is an archipelago of islands located in the Caribbean Sea, with the geographic coordinates 21¬∞3N, 80¬∞00W. Cuba is the principal island, which is surrounded by four main groups of islands. These are the Colorados, the Sabana-Camag√ºey, the Jardines de la Reina and the Canarreos. The main island of Cuba constitutes most of the nation's land area or 105,006†km2 (40,543†sq†mi) and is the seventeenth-largest island in the world by land area. The second largest island in Cuba is the Isla de la Juventud (Isle of Youth) in the southwest, with an area of 3,056†km2 (1,180†sq†mi). Cuba has a total land area of 110,860†km2 (42,803†sq†mi).
The main island consists mostly of flat to rolling plains. At the southeastern end is the Sierra Maestra, a range of steep mountains whose highest point is the Pico Real del Turquino at 1,975†metres (6,480†ft).

The local climate is tropical, though moderated by northeasterly trade winds that blow year-round. In general (with local variations), there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from May to October. The average temperature is 21†¬∞C (70†¬∞F) in January and 27†¬∞C (81†¬∞F) in July.
The warm temperatures of the Caribbean Sea and the fact that the island of Cuba sits across the access to the Gulf of Mexico combine to make Cuba prone to frequent hurricanes. These are most common in September and October.

The most important Cuban mineral economic resource is nickel. Cuba has the second largest nickel reserves in the world after Russia.[13] Sherritt International, a Canadian energy company, operates a large nickel mining facility in Moa. Another leading mineral resource is cobalt, a byproduct of nickel mining operations. Cuba is the fifth largest producer of refined cobalt in the world.[13]
Recent oil exploration has revealed that the North Cuba Basin could produce approximately 4.6†billion barrels (730,000,000†m3) to 9.3†billion barrels (1.48√ó109†m3) of oil. In 2006, Cuba started to test-drill these locations for possible exploitation.[14][15][16]

Fourteen provinces and one special municipality (the Isla de la Juventud) compose Cuba. These were formerly part of six larger historical provinces: Pinar del R√≠o, Habana, Matanzas, Las Villas, Camag√ºey and Oriente. The present subdivisions closely resemble those of Spanish military provinces during the Cuban Wars of Independence, when the most troublesome areas were subdivided.
The provinces are further divided into 170 municipalities.

Prior to the arrival of the Spanish, the island was inhabited by Native American peoples known as the Ta√≠no and Ciboney whose ancestors had come from South and possibly North and Central America at least several and perhaps 60 to 80 centuries before.[17] The Ta√≠no were farmers and the Ciboney were farmers and hunter-gatherers; some have suggested that copper trade was significant and mainland artifacts[18] have been found.
On October 12, 1492, Christopher Columbus landed near what is now Baracoa and claimed the island for Spain,[19] and naming it Isla Juana after Prince Juan of Asturias.[20] In 1511 the first Spanish settlement was founded by Diego Vel√°zquez de Cu√©llar at Baracoa; other towns including the future capital of the island San Cristobal de la Habana (founded in 1515) soon followed.
The Spanish enslaved the approximately 100,000 indigenous people that resisted conversion to Christianity, setting them primarily to the task of searching for gold, and within a century they had all but disappeared. Most scholars now believe that infectious disease was the overwhelming cause of the population decline of the indigenous people.[21][22]

Cuba remained a Spanish possession for almost 400 years (1511-1898). Its economy was based on plantation agriculture, mining and the export of sugar, coffee and tobacco to Europe and later to North America. The small land-owning elite of Spanish-descended settlers held social and economic power, supported by a population of Spaniards born on the island (Criollos), other Europeans, and African-descended slaves.
In the 1820s, when the other parts of Spain's empire in Latin America rebelled and formed independent states, Cuba remained loyal, although there was some agitation for independence, leading the Spanish Crown to give it the motto "La Siempre Fidelisima Isla" (The Always Most Faithful Island). This loyalty was due partly to Cuban settlers' dependence on Spain for trade, protection from pirates, protection against a slave rebellion and partly because they feared the rising power of the United States more than they disliked Spanish rule.
Cuba's proximity to the U.S. has been a powerful influence on its history. Throughout the 19th century, Southern politicians in the U.S. plotted the island's annexation as a means of strengthening
