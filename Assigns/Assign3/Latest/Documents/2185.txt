PvPGN
PvPGN (Player vs Player Gaming Network) is a free and open source software project offering emulation of various gaming network servers. It is published under the GPL and based upon bnetd. PvPGN was a recommended project of the month in the August 2005 issue of Linux+ magazine.
It currently supports most features of all Battle.net clients (Diablo, Diablo II, Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, StarCraft, StarCraft: Brood War, Warcraft II: Battle.net Edition, Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne). It also offers basic support for Westwood Online clients (Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun, Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2, Command & Conquer: Yuri's Revenge). Westwood Online support is still very experimental.
A PvPGN Server can be used:

The list of supported clients and their minimum version required is:


PvPGN is written in C, and it currently is a highly scalable, mature piece of software, with records broken of over 21,000 real-time connections on the Ender server.

Starting with PvPGN 1.99, PvPGN has been recoded in C++. This is an evolutionary not revolutionary process, thus the C code base is being converted to C++ one section at a time. This is not a fresh re-write. Also the new C++ branch is stored in an SVN repository as opposed to CVS.


Many users of PvPGN seem to believe that click lag issues with PvPGN are relevant to the server, this is incorrect. Most Battle.Net games use a Peer-to-peer protocol which relies on independent hosting systems instead of a server like Counter-Strike Steam, which means the slowest peer on the network is the overall speed of every player.
