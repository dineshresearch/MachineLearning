Jena Six
The Jena Six are a group of six black teenagers charged with the beating of Justin Barker, a white student at Jena High School in Jena, Louisiana, United States, on December 4, 2006. Barker was injured, but was released from the emergency room the same day.[1] He has since brought suit against members of the Jena Six, their parents, the school district, and others allegedly involved.[2]
A number of events took place in and around Jena in the months preceding the Barker assault, which have been linked to an alleged escalation of racial tensions. These events included the hanging of nooses from a tree in the high school courtyard, two violent confrontations between white and black youths, and the destruction by fire of the main building of Jena High School. The incidents were often linked in the extensive news coverage regarding the Jena Six.[3]
Six individuals (Robert Bailey, then aged 17; Mychal Bell, then 16; Carwin Jones, then 18; Bryant Purvis, then 17; Jesse Ray Beard, then 14; and Theo Shaw, then 17) were arrested in the assault on Barker. One, Mychal Bell, was initially convicted as an adult of aggravated battery and conspiracy to commit aggravated battery. His convictions were overturned on the ground that he should have been tried as a juvenile. Prior to a retrial in juvenile court, he pled guilty to a reduced charge of simple battery. The other five defendants still await trial.[4]
The Jena Six case sparked protests by those viewing the arrests and subsequent charges, initially attempted second-degree murder (though later reduced), as excessive and racially discriminatory. The protesters asserted that white Jena youths involved in other incidents were treated leniently. On September 20, 2007, between 15,000 and 20,000 protesters marched on Jena in what was described as the "largest civil rights demonstration in years".[5][6] Related protests were held in other US cities on the same day.[7] Subsequent reactions include songs alluding to the Jena Six, a considerable number of editorials and opinion columns, and Congressional hearings.


At Jena High School, about 10% of students are black and more than 80% are white, reflecting the population of the town of Jena, which has about 3,000 people.[8] Some early reporting indicated that students of different races seldom sat together, although this has been disputed.[9] According to early reports, black students typically sat on bleachers near the auditorium, while white students sat under a large tree in the center of the school courtyard, referred to as the "white tree" or "prep tree".[3] According to some of the school's teachers and administrators, the tree in question was not a "white tree" and students of all races had sat under it at one time or another.[9]
A school assembly was held on August 31, 2006. A black male freshman asked the principal whether he could sit under the tree.[10] According to Donald Washington, United States Attorney for the Western District of Louisiana, the principal stated that the question was posed in a "jocular fashion".[11] The principal told the students they could "sit wherever they wanted".[10] According to some reports, the freshman and his friends then sat under the tree.[12]
The following morning, nooses were discovered hanging from the tree. Reports differ as to whether there were two[9] or three[3] nooses. A black teacher described seeing both white and black students "playing with [the nooses], pulling on them, jump-swinging from them, and putting their heads through them" that same day.[9] Craig Franklin, assistant editor of The Jena Times, stated that the nooses were actually a prank by three students aimed at white members of the school rodeo team, and that the school's investigating committee had concluded that "the three young teens had no knowledge that nooses symbolize the terrible legacy of the lynchings of countless blacks in American history."[13] The names of those who hung the nooses have not been publicly disclosed.

The school disciplinary process that followed is unclear. It has been reported that the principal learned that three white students were responsible and recommended expulsion, that the board of education overruled his recommendation, and that school superintendent Roy Breithaupt agreed with the overruling. It was initially reported that the punishment was reduced to three days of in-school suspension.[1][3] However, the three students were isolated at an alternative school "for about a month",[9] spent two weeks on in-school suspension, served Saturday detentions, had to attend Discipline Court, were referred to Families in Need of Services, and had to have an evaluation before they were able to return to school as part of the district's Crisis Management Policy Procedures.[9]
The school superintendent was quoted as saying, "Adolescents play pranks. I don't think it was a threat against anybody."[14] Black residents of Jena have stated that this decision stoked racial tensions leading to subsequent events.[1]
According to US Attorney Donald Washington, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigators and federal examiners of the crime found that the hanging of the nooses "had all the markings of a hate crime". However, it could not be prosecuted as such because it failed to meet federal standards for the teens to be certified as adults.[15] La Salle Parish District Attorney J. Reed Walters stated that Washington had found no federal statute under which the teens could be prosecuted, just as he himself had found no applicable state statute.[16] Walters opined: "The people that [hung the nooses] should be ashamed of what they unleashed on this town."[17]
Police were called to the school in the days after the noose incident.[18] The principal took action by calling an assembly on September 6, 2006. The Jena Police Department asked Walters to attend and speak at the assembly. Already pressed for time due to a case under preparation, Walters felt that the students were not paying proper attention to his message. Walters warned the students "I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. With the stroke of a pen I can make life miserable for you or ruin your life. So I want you to call me before you do something stupid."[18] Though black students state Walters was looking at them when he made the comments, Walters and school board member Billy Fowler, also present, deny it.[3] Walters said that he was irritated at "two or three girls, white girls, [who] were chit-chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones".[13]

On November 30, 2006, the main building of the high school was set on fire and burned down. Although it would be many months before the perpetrators were known, the news media widely cited the fire as a racially-charged event leading up to the assault on Barker.[3] On December 28, 2007, LaSalle Parish Sheriff-elect Scott Franklin announced that an investigation had shown that the fire was set in an effort to destroy grade records in the building and to close the school for a time. Six racially diverse male suspects (three juveniles and three adults) had been arrested, and two more adult males were being sought. Franklin indicated that the fire was not racially motivated, and had no connection to the Jena Six.[19] Two of the arson defendants have thus far pled guilty, and have been sentenced to ten years in prison, with restitution ordered in the amount of $10 million.[20]
On Friday, December 1, 2006, a private party was held at the Jena Fair Barn.[11] Bailey and four other black youths attempted to enter the party at about 11:00 p.m. According to US Attorney Washington, they were told by a woman that no one was allowed inside without an invitation. The youths persisted, stating that some friends were already in attendance at the party. A white male, who was not a student, then jumped in front of the woman and a fight ensued. After the fight broke up, the woman told both the white male and the black students to leave the party. Once outside, the black students were involved in another fight with a group of white males who were not students.[11] Justin Sloan, a white male, was charged with battery for his role in the fight and was put on probation. Bailey later stated that one of the white males broke a beer bottle over his head,[1] but there are no records of Bailey receiving medical treatment.[11]
The following day, another incident occurred at the Gotta Go convenience store, outside Jena in unincorporated LaSalle Parish, between Matt Windham and three black youths including Bailey.[21] Law enforcement reported that the accounts contradicted each other. Windham alleged that Bailey and his friends chased him, that he ran to get his gun, and that the students wrestled it away from him. According to the black students, as they left the convenience store, they were confronted by Windham with a shotgun. They stated they wrestled the gun away from him and fled the scene. Bailey was charged with disturbing the peace, second degree robbery, and theft of a firearm.[19]

On December 4, 2006 17-year-old Justin Barker, a white Jena High School student, was assaulted at school by a group of black students. Superintendent Breithaupt described the assault as a "premeditated ambush and attack by six students against one. The victim attacked was beaten and kicked into a state of bloody unconsciousness."[22] Barker was released after three hours of treatment and observation at a local emergency room for a concussion and an eye that had swollen shut.[1] The emergency physician's record shows that he also had injuries to his face, ears, and hand.[23] Nevertheless, he attended his school's Ring ceremony that evening. He later testified, "I waited 11 years to go to it. I wasn't going to let that get in my way," though he ended up leaving the dance early due to pain.[24] During the trial, Barker also testified that his face was badly swollen after the attack and that he suffered a loss of vision in one eye for three weeks. He also stated that he had suffered recurring headaches and forgetfulness since the attack.[25]
At a Law Day luncheon on April 30, 2008, US Attorney Washington decried what he termed "distortion of several key facts" by supporters of the Jena Six, most notably the linking of the Barker assault to the noose hangings.[26] In July 2007, Washington had noted that of the more than 40 statements taken regarding the assault, none mentioned the noose incident.[11] Walters likewise indicated there was no linkage between the noose incident and the beating. "When this case was brought to me and during our investigation and during the trial, there was no such linkage ever suggested. This compact story line has only been suggested after the fact."[15] Although Washington believes that both the noose hangings and the Barker assault were symptoms of racial tension, he has also said that there was no apparent lingering anger after the noose hangings.[26]

Law enforcement arrested six students, eventually dubbed the "Jena Six", who were accused in the attack.[27] Five of them (Robert Bailey, Jr., then 17; Mychal Bell, then 16; Carwin Jones, then 18; Bryant Purvis, then 17; and Theo Shaw, then 17) were charged with attempted murder.[21] The sixth student, Jesse Ray Beard (also known as Jesse Rae Beard), was charged as a juvenile. Despite his age, Mychal Bell was charged as an adult.[28] This was due to Bell's previous criminal record and because Walters believed Bell initiated the attack.[29]

District Judge J. P. Mauffray, Jr. presided over Bell's trial. On the first day of trial, June 26, 2007, Walters reduced the charges to aggravated second-degree battery and conspiracy to commit aggravated second-degree battery.[30] Because aggravated battery requires the use of a "dangerous weapon",[31] Walters argued that the tennis shoes that Bell had worn while allegedly kicking Barker were dangerous weapons.[32] A number of witnesses testified that they saw Bell strike Barker, while other witnesses were unsure Bell was involved.[32] Before the trial began, public defender Blane Williams had urged Bell to accept a plea bargain. At trial he rested the defense case without calling any witnesses or offering any evidence.[32] All six members of Bell's jury were white. The 150-person jury pool included black citizens, who make up 10 percent of the parish's population, but none of the 50 potential jurors who showed up were black.[9] Williams did not challenge the composition of the jury pool.[32]
The jury found Bell guilty, and he faced the possibility of up to 22 years in prison. The judge scheduled sentencing for September 20, 2007. Bell's new defense attorneys, Louis Scott and Carol Powell-Lexing, requested a new trial on the grounds that Bell should not have been tried as an adult.[33] A request to lower Bell's $90,000 bond was denied on August 24, 2007, due to his juvenile record. Bell had been put on probation for a battery that occurred December 25, 2005. While on probation he was convicted of another battery charge and two charges of criminal damage to property.[34] One of the battery charges was reportedly for punching a 17-year-old girl in the face.[35] The media had initially reported that Bell had no prior criminal record.[1] On September 4, 2007,[36] Judge Mauffray vacated the conspiracy conviction on the grounds that Bell should have been tried as a juvenile, but let the battery conviction stand.[37] Bell appealed his conviction, principally on the ground that he had been improperly tried as an adult, and on September 14, 2007, Louisiana's Third Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Bell's battery conviction, agreeing that the remaining charge was not among those for which a juvenile may be tried as an adult.[28]
Following the appellate ruling,[38] on September 21, 2007, Judge Mauffray denied the request for Bell to be eligible for bail pending possible further appeal.[39][40] On September 26, Walters announced that the prosecution would not appeal the appellate ruling, but would try Bell as a juvenile.[41] Bell was then released on $45,000 bond.[29] Bell was subject to electronic monitoring and was under the supervision of a probation officer.
On October 11, 2007, Mauffray found that Bell had violated the terms of his probation for previous convictions. The judge then sentenced Bell to 18 months in a juvenile facility on two counts of simple battery and two counts of criminal destruction of property, and Bell was taken into custody. According to Walters, the matter was unrelated to the assault on Barker, and it was not mentioned during the proceedings.[42] The defense filed a motion to dismiss the Barker charges on the ground that retrying Bell would amount to double jeopardy. On November 8, 2007, Mauffray denied the motion.[43]
Bell's retrial in the Barker assault was scheduled for December 6. Three days before the trial began, he pled guilty to a reduced charge of battery, and was sentenced to 18 months in a juvenile facility, with credit for time served. He agreed to testify against any of the others who go to trial. All appeals were dropped as part of the plea agreement.[44]

On September 4, 2007, charges against Carwin Jones and Theo Shaw were reduced to aggravated second-degree battery and conspiracy,[45] as were those of Robert Bailey, Jr. on September 10.[46] Bryant Purvis was arraigned on reduced charges of aggravated battery and conspiracy to commit aggravated battery on November 7, 2007, pleading not guilty.[47] Because Louisiana law considers seventeen-year-olds to be adults for purposes of criminal culpability, the charges for these four were unaffected by the appellate ruling overturning Bell's conviction.[28]
Proceedings were on hold for some time pending resolution of various motions that Mauffray be required to recuse himself. On July 31, 2008, Mauffray was removed from the cases by Judge Thomas Yeager for making questionable comments about the defendants.[48] The Louisiana Supreme Court assigned Judge Yeager to hear the five remaining cases by order signed August 4, 2008[4] While Walters appealed the recusal order, the appeal was dismissed on March 4, 2009 as moot, or no longer relevant, as Mauffray had left the bench at the end of 2008.[49]


Initially, the Jena Six were largely ignored by the United States national media, though covered locally and within Louisiana. Both The Jena Times[13] and The Town Talk[50] (a regional newspaper published in Alexandria, Louisiana) covered the story from its inception. A number of African-American bloggers also covered the story before there was mainstream national press coverage.[51] The first piece from outside the area on the case ran on May 9, 2007, in Left Turn, a small alternative news magazine.[52] The first mainstream US media outlet to cover the matter was the Chicago Tribune, whose Southwest Bureau Chief, Howard Witt, wrote a piece covering the story on May 20.[14] Witt had received a summary of the situation[53] from Alan Bean, a Texas minister who had founded the advocacy group Friends of Justice.[54] That document was also provided to other reporters and bloggers. In it Bean demanded that outside authorities, not those in LaSalle Parish, deal with the case, and that no incarceration occur.[53] Britain's The Observer also featured an article on the case on May 20.[55]
A segment on a BBC program This World followed on May 24. On July 3, Bill Quigley wrote a column for the website Truthout.org.[56] The case began to receive extensive media coverage in September 2007. News reports from Jena have evoked the Civil Rights Movement,[57] made references to lynching,[57] or evoked Jim Crow.[57] Some sources have pointed out inaccurate reporting by the media. The Associated Press published an article noting the various reporting errors that have been made, including whether the tree was a "white tree", the number of nooses, and the discipline meted out on the nooses-hanging students.[9] Based on this, MTV posted a retraction for incorrect information that it had reported on the case from other news sources.[58]

Many major editorial pages and columnists have been sympathetic to the supporters of the Jena Six and have used the case to discuss broader trends of racism in the US criminal justice system and to call for a renewed civil rights movement. Most editorials were published around the time of the Jena rally. The New York Post, in a September 23, 2007 editorial, stated "it's impossible to examine the case of the
