Michelle Malkin
Michelle Malkin (born October 20, 1970, née Maglalang) is an American commentator and blogger.[1][2] Her weekly syndicated column appears in a number of newspapers and websites.[1] She has been a guest on MSNBC, Fox News Channel, C-SPAN, and national radio programs. Malkin has written three books.

Malkin was born Michelle Maglalang on October 20, 1970 in Philadelphia to Filipino parents, Rafaela and Dr. Apolo Maglalang, while they were in the United States on student visas.[3][4] She grew up in Absecon, New Jersey.[5] Malkin graduated from Oberlin College, which she described as a "radically left-wing, liberal arts college."[6]
In 1993 she married Jesse Malkin, a Rhodes Scholar and former economist for the RAND Corporation.[7] As of 2004, Jesse was a stay-at-home dad raising their two children.[8]

Malkin began her career at the Los Angeles Daily News, working as a columnist from 1992 to 1994. In 1996, she moved to Seattle, Washington, where she wrote columns for The Seattle Times. She became a nationally syndicated columnist with Creators Syndicate in 1999.[9] [10] She also has been a frequent commentator for FOX News Channel and former guest-host of The O'Reilly Factor.
Her first book, Invasion: How America Still Welcomes Terrorists, Criminals, and Other Foreign Menaces, was published in 2002 and was a New York Times bestseller.
In November 2004, The Virginian-Pilot dropped her column, calling her among other things "an Asian Ann Coulter."[11] Malkin responded "I'm not Asian, I'm American, for goodness' sake. I would take the comparison to Ann Coulter as somewhat of a compliment."[12]
In 2004, she wrote In Defense of Internment: The Case for 'Racial Profiling' in World War II and the War on Terror, defending Japanese American internment by the United States Government during World War II. She related the theme to the contemporary War on Terrorism, which engendered criticism from several Asian American civil rights organizations.[13] The "Historians' Committee for Fairness," a group of professors, condemned the book for not having undergone peer review and argued that its central thesis is false.[14] An attempt to ban the book from the Manzanar National Historic Site failed.[15]. The Hawaiian-based newspaper Midweek dropped her column as a result of the controversy.[16] Malkin's third book, Unhinged: Exposing Liberals Gone Wild was released in October 2005.
In 2007 she announced that she would not return to The O'Reilly Factor, claiming that the show had mishandled a dispute over derogatory statements made about her by Geraldo Rivera in a Boston Globe interview.[17][18]

In June 2004 she launched a political blog which quickly became a popular conservative blog, at most times residing among the top five conservative political blogs.[19] After initially allowing reader comments, she disabled them, attributing her decision to an intolerable level of obscene and racist comments.[20] A 2007 memo from the National Republican Senatorial Committee described Malkin as one of the five "best-read national conservative bloggers."[21] In June 2007, she revamped the blog, moving it to WordPress and a larger server.[22] With the new redesign, subscribed readers can once again post comments, but only if they registered before 5 p.m. on June 22, 2007.[23]
Malkin created a stir with a May 28, 2008, entry on her website which described a neck scarf worn by Rachael Ray in a Dunkin' Donuts advertisement as "a jihadi chic keffiyeh".[24] Dunkin' Donuts subsequently pulled the advertisement, issuing the following statement:

In April 2006, Students Against War (SAW), a campus group at University of California, Santa Cruz, staged a protest against the presence of military recruiters on campus, and sent out a press release containing contact details (names, phone numbers and e-mail addresses) of their three-person "ad-hoc press team" for use by reporters. Malkin included these contact details in a blog post criticizing SAW and UCSC.[26] Malkin claims the contact information was originally taken from SAW's own website, but that later SAW had removed the information and had "wiped the info from the cached version."[27] SAW "politely asked"[28] her to remove the contact details; Malkin refused, writing in her blog "I am leaving it up. If you are contacting them, I do not condone death threats or foul language. As for SAW, my message is this: You are responsible for your individual actions. Other individuals are responsible for theirs. Grow up and take responsibility."[26] Malkin noted that none of the three students contacted her with that request, and posted a screenshot from one of several Indymedia websites where the complete press release was still available.[29] After Malkin's post, the three SAW contacts received abusive emails and phone calls, including death threats.[28][broken citation] Malkin claims that she received hostile e-mails regarding this matter.[30] Subsequently, people opposed to Malkin published her private home address, phone number, photos of her neighborhood and maps to her house on several websites. Malkin has alleged that this forced her to remove one of her children from school and move her family.[31][broken citation]
In July 2006, Malkin noted that the New York Times had printed photos and other details of the summer homes of Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, and alleged that "[t]here is a concerted, organized effort to dig up and publicize the private home information of prominent conservatives in the media and blogosphere to intimidate them."[32] Two days later, the Center for American Progress reported that Rumsfeld's office had given permission for the Times story and that the Secret Service said there was no security threat.[33]


On April 24, 2006, Hot Air, a "conservative Internet broadcast network" went into operation, with Malkin as founder/CEO.[34] She intended the blog to provide "content and analysis you can't get anywhere else on a daily basis–both on the blog and in our original video features."[35] Other staffers include "Allahpundit" and Bryan Preston. The latter was replaced by Ed Morrissey on February 25, 2008.[36]
After Malkin criticized hip hop artist Akon for "degrading women" in a Vent episode, Akon's record label, Universal Music Group, forced YouTube to remove the video by issuing a DMCA takedown notice,[37] but decided to retract this notice[38] after the Electronic Frontier Foundation joined Malkin and Hot Air in contesting the removal as a misuse of copyright law.[39]
In an interview with Business Week magazine in July 2007, Malkin remarked "We’re doing what few other blogs can do. We serve up terabytes of bandwidth...I'm shelling out for gold-plated servers. That's expensive, and we want to be able to withstand huge traffic surges." [40]

In a 2003 Jewish World Review column about Yaser Esam Hamdi, Malkin questioned "whether Hamdi should even be considered an American at all" and argued against the legal doctrine of birthright citizenship, asserting that "the custom of granting automatic citizenship at birth to children of tourists and temporary workers such as Hamdi, tourists, and to countless 'anchor babies' delivered by illegal aliens on American soil, undermines the integrity of citizenship—not to mention national security".[41]
She also opposes sanctuary cities, in which local authorities do not enforce all national immigration laws, such as the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) or coordinate with agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). In light of the August 2007 execution-style murder of three college students in Newark, New Jersey, she has repeated her criticisms of politicians' posture towards sanctuary cities. (The prime suspect in the murders is an illegal immigrant with a history of violent felonies.) In particular, she criticized former New York City mayor, Rudy Giuliani, then a Republican candidate for the 2008 presidential election. She responded to his proposal for a tamper-proof identification card with this comment:
What Rudy-come-lately fails to comprehend is that there are already multiple alien tracking databases mandated by federal law that have yet to be fully implemented, integrated and used. The reason they don’t work is because open-borders interests have sabotaged them by restricting funding for them, objecting to them on civil liberties grounds, and pushing local and state governments to forbid public employees from checking them to verify citizenship status. Ring a bell, Rudy?[42]
She supports coordination with federal authorities through the use of Section 287(g) of the IIRIRA to investigate, detain, and arrest aliens on civil and criminal grounds. [43] [44]
