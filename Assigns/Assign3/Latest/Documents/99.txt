Illegal immigration to the United States
Illegal immigration to the United States refers to the act of foreign nationals violating U.S. immigration policies and national laws by immigrating to the United States without proper consent from the United States government.[1]
The Illegal immigrant population of the United States is estimated to be about 11 million people, down from a historic peak of 12.5 million people in 2007.[2] According to a Pew Hispanic Center report, 57% of illegal immigrants are from Mexico, 24% are from other Latin American countries, primarily from Central America,[3] 9% are from Asia, 6% are from Europe and Canada, and 4% are from the rest of the world.[3]

There are many characteristics shared among illegal immigrants living in the United States. A trend that grew from the 1990s to the late 2000s, illegal immigrants continue to outpace the number of legal immigrants--a trend that has held steady since the 1990s. While the majority of illegal aliens continue to concentrate in places with existing large communities of Hispanics, increasingly illegal immigrants are settling throughout the rest of the country.[4]
Statistically, an estimated 13.9 million people live in families in which the head of household or the spouse is an unauthorized immigrant.[4] Illegal immigrants arriving in recent years tend to be better educated than those who have been in the country a decade or more. A quarter of all immigrants who have arrived in recent years have at least some college education. Nonetheless, illegal immigrants as a group tend to be less educated than other sections of the U.S. population: 49 percent haven't completed high school, compared with 9 percent of native-born Americans and 25 percent of legal immigrants.[4]
Illegal immigrants are found working in many sectors of the U.S. economy. According to National Public Radio, about 3 percent work in agriculture; 33 percent have jobs in service industries, and substantial numbers can be found in construction and related occupations (16 percent), and in production, installation and repair (17 percent).[4] According to USA Today, about 4 percent work in farming; 21 percent have jobs in service industries; and substantial numbers can be found in construction and related occupations (19 percent), and in production, installation and repair (15 percent), with 12% in sales, 10% in management, and 8% in transportation.[5] Illegal immigrants have lower incomes than both legal immigrants and native-born Americans, but earnings do increase somewhat the longer an individual is in the country.[4]
A common bond that unites many illegal immigrants is that they are “sojourners: they come to the United States for several years but eventually return to their home country."[6]

As of 2006[7], the following data table shows a spread of distribution of locations where illegal immigrants reside by state:

In March 2006 the Pew Hispanic Center (PHC) estimated the illegal population ranged from 11.5 to 12 million individuals[8], a number supported by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO)[9]. Of these 12 million, 57% of illegal immigrants originate from Mexico, 24% are from other Latin American countries, 9% originate stem from various parts of Asia, 6% come from Europe and Canada, and 4% from the other parts of the world.[3]
According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security[10], the countries of origin for the largest numbers of illegal immigrants are as follows:
For 2005
For 2006:[11]
Furthermore, The Urban Institute, a respected Washington, D.C. based nonpartisan research group that collects data and conducts policy research issues, estimates "between 65,000 and 75,000 undocumented Canadians currently live in the United States."[12]

People become illegal immigrants in one of three ways: entering without authorization or inspection, staying beyond the authorized period after legal entry, or by violating the terms of legal entry.[13] Their mode of violation breaks down as follows: If the suspect entered legally without inspection, then the suspect would be classified as either a “Non-Immigrant Visa Overstayer” (4 to 5.5 million) or a “Border Crossing Card Violator” (250,000 to 500,000). If the suspect entered illegally without inspection, then the suspect is classified as having “Evaded the Immigration Inspectors and Border Patrol” (6 to 7 million).[14]

There are an estimated half a million illegal entries into the United States each year.[15] The unfenced, rural mountain and desert border between Arizona and Mexico has become a major entrance area for illegal immigration to the United States, due in part to the increased difficulty of crossing illegally into California.[citation needed][15]
A common means of border crossing is through the hiring of "coyotes," people-smugglers who transport illegal immigrants in return for pay.[16]
The tightening of border enforcement has disrupted the traditional circular movement of many migrant workers from Mexico by increasing the costs and risks of crossing the border, thereby reducing their rate of return migration to Mexico. The difficulty and expense of the journey has prompted many migrant workers to stay in the United States longer or indefinitely. [17]

A traveler is considered a "visa overstay" once he or she remains in the United States after the time of admission has expired. The time of admission varies greatly from traveler to traveler depending on what visa class into which they were admitted. Visa overstays tend to be somewhat more educated and better off financially than those who crossed the border illegally.[18]
To help track visa overstayer the US-VISIT (United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology) program collects and retains biographic, travel, and biometric information, such as photographs and fingerprints, of foreign nationals seeking entry into the United States. It also requires electronic readable passports containing this information.
Visa overstays mostly enter with tourist or business visas.[19]
In the year 1994, more than half[20] of illegal immigrants were Visa overstayers whereas in 2006, about 45%[21] of illegal immigrants were Visa overstayers.

One method of illegal immigration involves obtaining visas on false pretenses. The most common form of visa fraud is a so-called "green card marriage", whereby a foreign national obtains permanent residency, and potentially citizenship, through a sham marriage to a United States citizen or legal resident. [22] According to a 2008 study by the Center for Immigration Studies, there were a number of different ways in which marriages were arranged for purposes of avoiding immigration laws rather than for couples to build a life together, an act that is illegal in the United States. Among others:[23]


The continuing practice of hiring unauthorized workers has been referred to as “the magnet for illegal immigration.” [24]As a significant percentage of employers are willing to hire illegal immigrants for higher pay than they would typically receive in their former country, illegal immigrants have prime motivation to cross borders. The economic incentives that drive illegal immigration benefit both the illegal workers whose desire to work and live in the United States and the employers who want low-cost labor.[citation needed]
Mexico had a gross domestic product (in terms of PPP) of more than US$1.3 trillion in 2007,[25] and more billionaires than Switzerland[26] (including Carlos Slim whom Time Magazine[27][28], ABC News, [29] and CNN Money [30] claim is the world's richest man and who owns 8% of the country's GDP[26]). Yet according to the World Bank 17.6% of Mexico's population lives in "extreme" poverty, while 30.1% live in "moderated" poverty, for a total of 47.7%.[31] In addition, the average annual income for a worker in Mexico is around USD$2,000. However, the poorest 40% of the population receive only about USD$550 annually and often fail to be able to afford adequate necessities. The large disparity between the upper income class and the lower income class is a key factor in the overall majority of workers in Mexico being poor and resorting to illegal acts to improve living situations.[32]
In 2003, then-President of Mexico, Vicente Fox stated that remittances "are our biggest source of foreign income, bigger than oil, tourism or foreign investment" and that "the money transfers grew after Mexican consulates started giving identity cards to their citizens in the United States." He stated that money sent from Mexican workers in the United States to their families back home reached a record $12 billion.[33]. Two years later, in 2005, the World Bank stated that Mexico was receiving $18.1 billion in remittances and that it ranked third (behind only India and China) among the countries receiving the greatest amount of remittances.[34]

According to demographer Jeffery Passel of the Pew Hispanic Center, the flow of Mexicans to the U. S. has produced a "network effect" - furthering immigration as Mexicans moved to join relatives already in the U.S.[35] The Pew Hispanic Center describes that the recent dramatic increase in the population of illegal immigrants has sparked more illegal immigrants to cross borders. Once the extended families of illegal immigrants cross national borders, they create a “network effect” by building large communities.[35]

According to Ramah McKay of the Migration Policy Institute, many analysts believe that the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. could be reduced significantly by alleviating the backlog by processing increased numbers of applicants each year and raising the cap on the first and second preference categories for family reunification.[36]


The Rockridge Institute asks, "What role have international trade agreements had in creating or exacerbating people's urge to flee their homelands? If capital is going to freely cross borders, should people and labor be able to do so as well, going where globalization takes the jobs?... Such a framing of the problem would lead to a solution involving the Secretary of State, conversations with Mexico and other Central American countries, and a close examination of the promises of North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to raise standards of living around the globe.[37]
The Mexican government failed to follow through on promises to the United States to invest billions of dollars in roads, schooling, sanitation, housing, and other infrastructure to accommodate new "maquiladoras" (border factories) that had been envisioned as a way to reduce illegal immigration as a part of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).[35] As a result few were built, and China was able to out-compete Mexico for manufacturing goods for the United States market.[35] Rather than increasing as planned, the number of manufacturing workers in Mexico dropped from 4.1 million in 2000 to 3.5 million in 2004.[35] Also, price pressure from more efficient United States corn producers and the elimination of tariffs under NAFTA[38] caused the price of maize to fall 70% in Mexico between 1994 and 2001, and the number of farm jobs to decrease from 8.1 million in 1993 to 6.8 million in 2002.[39]
Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, a survey of international businessmen that ranks countries from least to most corrupt, ranks Mexico at 72nd place out of 179 countries[40]. (The Index ranks the U.S. in the 20th place. Lower ranking indicates less corruption.) According to Global Integrity's 2006 Mexico Country Report, corruption costs the Mexican economy as much as $60 billion per year[41]. A survey by the Center for the Study of Private Sector Economics (Centro de Estudios Económicos del Sector Privado), a Mexican research firm, estimates that 79 percent of companies in Mexico believe “illegal transactions” are a serious obstacle to business development[42], . The 1994 economic crisis in Mexico associated with rampant government corruption [43] resulted in a greatly decreased U.S. dollar value of Mexican wages relative to U.S. production workers[44][45]
