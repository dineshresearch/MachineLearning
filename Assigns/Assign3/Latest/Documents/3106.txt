Austria  /Àà…îÀêstria/ (help¬∑info) (German: √ñsterreich) ( √ñsterreich), officially the Republic of Austria (German: Republik √ñsterreich) ( Republik √ñsterreich (help¬∑info)), is a landlocked country in Central Europe. It borders both Germany and the Czech Republic to the north, Slovakia and Hungary to the east, Slovenia and Italy to the south, and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west. The capital is the city of Vienna on the Danube River.[2]
The origins of Austria date back to the ninth century, when the territory later known as Upper and Lower Austria became increasingly populated. The name "Ostarrichi" is first documented in an official document from 996. Since then this word has developed into √ñsterreich.[3]
Austria is a parliamentary representative democracy comprising nine federal states[4] and is one of six European countries that have declared permanent neutrality[5] and one of the few countries that includes the concept of everlasting neutrality in its constitution[6]. Austria has been a member of the United Nations since 1955[7] and joined the European Union in 1995.[8]
The German name √ñsterreich is derived from Old German Ostarr√Æchi "Eastern Territory".[9] The name was erroneously Latinized as "Austria" (Latin auster "south wind", metaphorically "south" thus austrƒÅlis "southern" and so on. There is no evidence for the region being called "South" anything in any other language). Reich can also mean "empire", and this connotation is the one that is understood in the context of the Austrian Empire/Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, Holy Roman Empire, although not in the context of the modern Republic of √ñsterreich. The term probably originates in a vernacular translation of the Medieval Latin name for the region: Marchia orientalis, which translates as "eastern marches" or "eastern borderland", as it was situated at the eastern edge of the Holy Roman Empire (and of the Duchy of Bavaria, respectively), that was also mirrored in the name Ostmark, for a short period applied after the Anschluss to Germany.
However, Friedrich Heer, one the most important Austrian historians in the 20th century, stated in his book Der Kampf um die √∂sterreichische Identit√§t (The Struggle Over Austrian Identity), that the Germanic form ostarr√Æchi was not a translation of the Latin word, but both resulted from a much older term originating in the Celtic languages of ancient Austria: More than 2,500 years ago, the major part of the actual country was called Norig by the Celtic population (Hallstatt culture); No- or Nor- meant East or Eastern,[citation needed] whereas Rig is the related to the modern German Reich; realm (among other things). Accordingly, Norig would essentially mean ostarr√Æchi and √ñsterreich, thus Austria. The Celtic name was eventually Latinized to noricum, when the Romans conquered and Romanized the country that later became Austria. The name of Noricum was then used to designate the Roman province.[citation needed]
The current official designation is the Republic of Austria (Republik √ñsterreich).[10] It was earlier (after the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy) known from 1918 as the State of German Austria (Staat Deutsch√∂sterreich), but the state was forced to change its name by the Treaty of Saint Germain to "Republik √ñsterreich" "Republic of Austria". The name "Deutsch-√ñsterreich" can be found on early 1920 stamps and Money. The name was changed again during the Austro-fascist regime (1934‚Äì1938), into Federal State of Austria (Bundesstaat √ñsterreich), but restored after regaining independence and the birth of the "Second Austrian Republic" "Zweite Republik" (1945 ‚Äì present).
During the period of monarchy, Austria was known as the Austrian Empire (Kaisertum √ñsterreich). After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the empire became known as Austro-Hungarian Monarchy reflecting the dual monarchy character.

Settled in ancient times,[4] the central European land that is now Austria was occupied in pre-Roman times by various Celtic tribes. The Celtic kingdom of Noricum was later claimed by the Roman Empire and made a province. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the area was invaded by Bavarians, Slavs and Avars.[11] Charlemagne conquered the area in 788, encouraged colonization, and introduced Christianity.[11] As part of Eastern Francia, the core areas that now encompass Austria were bequeathed to the house of Babenberg. The area was known as the marchia Orientalis and was given to Leopold of Babenberg in 976.[12]
The first record showing the name Austria is from The name Arnold, referring to the territory of the Babenberg March.[12] In 1156 the Privilegium Minus elevated Austria to the status of a duchy. In 1192, the Babenbergs also acquired the Duchy of Styria. With the death of Frederick II in 1246, the line of the Babenbergs went extinct.[13] As a result, Otakar II of Bohemia effectively assumed control of the duchies of Austria, Styria and Carinthia.[13] His reign came to an end with his defeat at D√ºrnkrut at the hands of Rudolf I of Germany in 1278.[14] Thereafter, until World War I, Austria's history was largely that of its ruling dynasty, the Habsburgs.
In the 14th and 15th centuries, the Habsburgs began to accumulate other provinces in the vicinity of the Duchy of Austria. In 1438, Duke Albert V of Austria was chosen as the successor to his father-in-law, Emperor Sigismund. Although Albert himself only reigned for a year, from then on, every emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was a Habsburg, with only one exception.
The Habsburgs began also to accumulate lands far from the Hereditary Lands. In 1477, Archduke Maximilian, only son of Emperor Frederick III, married the heiress Maria of Burgundy, thus acquiring most of the Netherlands for the family.[15][16] His son Philip the Fair married the heiress of Castile and Aragon, and thus acquired Spain and its Italian, African, and New World appendages for the Habsburgs.[15][16] In 1526, following the Battle of Moh√°cs, Bohemia and the part of Hungary not occupied by the Ottomans came under Austrian rule.[17] Ottoman expansion into Hungary led to frequent conflicts between the two empires, particularly evident in the so-called Long War of 1593 to 1606.
During the long reign of Leopold I (1657‚Äì1705) and following the successful defense of Vienna in 1683 (under the command of the King of Poland, John III Sobieski),[18] a series of campaigns resulted in bringing all of Hungary to Austrian control by the Treaty of Carlowitz in 1699. Emperor Charles VI relinquished many of the fairly impressive gains the empire made in the previous years, largely due to his apprehensions at the imminent extinction of the House of Habsburg. Charles was willing to offer concrete advantages in territory and authority in exchange for other powers' worthless recognitions of the Pragmatic Sanction that made his daughter Maria Theresa his heir. With the rise of Prussia the Austrian‚ÄìPrussian dualism began in Germany. Austria participated, together with Prussia and Russia, in the first and the third of the three Partitions of Poland (in 1772 and 1795).
Austria later became engaged in a war with Revolutionary France - at the beginning highly unsuccessful - with successive defeats at the hands of Napoleon meaning the end of the old Holy Roman Empire in 1806. Two years earlier,[19] in 1804, the Empire of Austria was founded. In 1814 Austria was part of the Allied forces that invaded France and brought to an end the Napoleonic wars. It thus emerged from the Congress of Vienna in 1815 as one of four of the continent's dominant powers. The same year, the German Confederation, (German: Deutscher Bund) was founded under the presidency of Austria. Because of unsolved social, political and national conflicts the German lands where shaken by the 1848 revolution aiming to create a unified Germany.[20] A unified Germany would have been possible either as a Greater Germany, or a Greater Austria or just the German Confederation without Austria at all. As Austria was not willing to relinquish its German-speaking territories to what would become the German Empire of 1848 the crown of the new formed empire was offered to the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. In 1864 Austria and Prussia fought together against Denmark, and successfully freed the independent duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. Nevertheless as they could not agree on a solution to the administration of the two duchies, they fought in 1866 the Austro-Prussian War. Defeated by Prussia in the Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz,
