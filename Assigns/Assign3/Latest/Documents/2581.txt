Just another Perl hacker
Just another Perl hacker, or JAPH, typically refers to a Perl program which prints "Just another Perl hacker," (the comma is canonical but is occasionally omitted). Short JAPH programs are often used as signatures in online forums, or as T-shirt designs. The phrase or acronym is also occasionally used (without code) for a signature.
JAPH programs are classically done using extremely obfuscated methods, in the spirit of the Obfuscated C Contest. More recently, as the phenomenon has become so well known, the phrase is sometimes used in ordinary examples (without obfuscation). Even more recently the P of JAPH can also stand for Perl 6, Parrot or Pugs.
The idea of using tiny Perl programs which print a signature as a signature was originated by Randal L. Schwartz, in his postings to the newsgroup comp.lang.perl. [1] (In fact, many of the JAPHs below are his.)

Embedding JAPH in opaque code:
Decoding JAPH from a transposed string literal:
Appearing as if it does something completely unrelated to printing JAPH:
Forking processes to print out one letter each in the correct order:[2]
Using only Perl keywords (no literals or punctuation):[3]
Using only punctuation, no alphanumeric characters (written by Eric Roode; only works on Unix and Unix-like systems):
ASCII art (to make this one work, be sure to set the console size to at least 120x50):[4]
