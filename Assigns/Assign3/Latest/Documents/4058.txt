The Russo-Japanese War (Japanese: Êó•Èú≤Êà¶‰∫â; Romaji: Nichi-Ro Sens≈ç; Russian: –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ-—è–ø–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –≤–æ–π–Ω–∞ Russko-Yaponskaya Voyna; simplified Chinese: Êó•‰øÑÊàò‰∫â; traditional Chinese: Êó•‰øÑÊà∞Áà≠; pinyin: R√¨√©zh√†nzhƒìng, 10 February 1904 ‚Äì 5 September 1905) or the Manchurian Campaign in some English sources, was a conflict that grew out of the rival imperialist ambitions of the Russian Empire and the Empire of Japan over Manchuria and Korea. The major theatres of operations were Southern Manchuria, specifically the area around the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden, and the seas around Korea, Japan, and the Yellow Sea.
The Russians were in constant pursuit of a warm water port on the Pacific Ocean, for their navy as well as for maritime trade. The recently established Pacific seaport of Vladivostok was operational only during the summer season, but Port Arthur would be operational all year. From the end of the First Sino-Japanese War, and 1903 negotiations between the tsars's government and Japan had proved futile. Japan chose war to protect its exclusive dominance in Korea. Russia, meanwhile, saw war as a means of distracting the populace from government repression and rallying patriotism in the aftermath of several general strikes.[1]
The resulting campaigns, in which the fledgling Japanese military consistently attained victory over the Russian forces arrayed against them, were unexpected by world observers. These victories, as time transpired, would dramatically transform the balance of power in East Asia, resulting in a reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. The embarrassing string of defeats increased Russian popular dissatisfaction with the inefficient and corrupt Tsarist government and proved a major cause of the Russian Revolution of 1905.

After the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the Meiji government hastened to assimilate Western ideas, technology, and customs. By the late 19th century, Japan had emerged from isolation and rapidly industrialized. The Japanese wished to preserve their sovereignty and to be recognized as an equal with the Western powers.[citation needed]
Russia, a major Imperial power, had ambitions in the East. By the 1890s the Russian Empire stretched from Poland in the west to the Kamchatka peninsula in the East.[2] With its construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway to the port of Vladivostok, Russia hoped to further consolidate its influence and presence in the region. Japan feared this, regarding Korea and Manchuria as vital protective buffers against Tsarist ambition.[citation needed]

The Japanese government regarded Korea, which was geo-politically close to Japan, as an essential part of its national security. The Japanese wanted, at the very least, to keep Korea independent under Japanese influence. Japan's subsequent defeat of China during the First Sino-Japanese War led to the Treaty of Shimonoseki under which China abandoned its own suzerainty over Korea and ceded Taiwan, Pescadores and the Liaodong Peninsula (Port Arthur) to Japan. However, the Russians persuaded Germany and France to join it in the Triple Intervention of April 1895, opposing Japanese claims on the Liaodong peninsula. Japan was forced to accept a larger indemnity from China instead.

In December 1897, just two years after the Triple Intervention, a threatening Russian fleet appeared off Port Arthur. The Russian Empire forced China to lease them Port Arthur, Talienwan and the surrounding waters. The Russians quickly fortified Port Arthur, their sole warm-water port on the Pacific coast, and of great strategic value. A year later, to consolidate their position, the Russians began a new railway from Harbin through Mukden to Port Arthur. Chinese anger over this railway contributed to the Boxer Rebellion, and the railway stations at Tiehling and Lioyang were burnt.[citation needed]
The Russians also began to make inroads into Korea, by 1898 they acquired mining and forestry concessions near Yalu and Tumen rivers,[3] alarming the Japanese Empire. Japan decided to strike before the Trans-Siberian Railway was complete.[citation needed]

The Russians and the Japanese were both part of the Eight-Nation Alliance which intervened to quell the Boxer Rebellion and relieve the international legations under siege in Beijing. As part of this intervention, Russia sent troops to Manchuria to protect its interests.[4] Russia assured the other powers that it would leave once the crisis subsided. However, by 1903 the Russians had not adhered to any timetable for withdrawal[5] and were actually strengthening their position in Manchuria.

The Japanese statesman It≈ç Hirobumi started to negotiate with the Russians. He believed that Japan was too weak to evict Russia militarily, so he proposed accepting Russian control over Manchuria in exchange for Japanese control of northern Korea. Meanwhile, Japan and Britain had signed the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in 1902, the British seeking to restrict naval competition by keeping the Russian Pacific seaports of Vladivostok and Port Arthur from their full use. Under the terms of the alliance, if any nation allied with Russia during a war with Japan, Britain would enter the war on Japan's side. Russia could thus no longer count on help from Germany or France if hostilities broke out.[citation needed]
On 28 July 1903, Kurino Shinichiro, the Japanese Minister at St. Petersburg, was instructed to register Japanese opposition to Russian plans for Manchuria. Negotiations proceeded, and by 13 January 1904 Japan again proposed accepting Russian control of Manchuria in return for guarantees of Japanese control in Korea. By 4 February 1904, Russia had not responded to this offer, and on 6 February the Minister, called on the Russian Foreign Minister, Count Lamsdorf, to take his leave, severing diplomatic relations between Japan and Russia.[6]
A "sense of urgency" within the Japanese government was now prevalent and they sought to acquire naval submarines from a "neutral" government as quickly as possible. Several months thereafter, the Imperial Japanese Navy purchased five Holland-type VII-P submarines from the American Electric Boat Company. They were (originally) assembled at Fore River Ship and Engine Company of Quincy, Massachusetts by December 1904. These first five submarines were then "knocked down" to be shipped in a clandestine fashion to the far east. These first of five submarines were shipped by freighter (in crate form) to the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal to be re-assembled under the direction of Arthur Leopold Busch. Busch was a naval architect and shipbuilder who was responsible for the IJN's first fleet of underwater craft ‚Äì delivered under his direction on behalf of the Electric Boat Company in 1905. The mission was carried out in relative secrecy as this war with Russia was still ongoing. Another Electric Boat representative, Frank Cable, was sent to Japan in the summer of 1905 to train the IJN (officers) in the handling and operation of these underwater naval craft.[citation needed]


Japan issued a declaration of war on 8 February 1904. However, three hours before Japan's declaration of war was received by the Russian Government, the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked the Russian Far East Fleet at Port Arthur. Czar
