OpenTTD
OpenTTD is an open source game engine for the Chris Sawyer game Transport Tycoon Deluxe. The most recent versions, beginning with version 0.6.0 released in April 2008, are written in C++.
OpenTTD duplicates the original game's features but also has numerous additions, including canals, revised rail station construction, and additional airports. Perhaps the most significant feature compared to the original game is its multiplayer capability. It offers LAN and Internet play via public and worldwide servers for up to eleven players. OpenTTD also includes numerous usability improvements not present in Transport Tycoon Deluxe.
OpenTTD incorporates many features from TTDPatch, and, like TTDPatch, is available under the GNU General Public License. Both OpenTTD and TTDPatch are not totally standalone gamesâ€”while OpenTTD does not need the Transport Tycoon Deluxe executables, it needs the game's graphics files. However, there is currently an effort to devise a new graphics standard (and new graphics) to eliminate this need.[1]
The game's legality has been questioned by some, since the initial versions were created by disassembling the binary from the official release.

After the original Transport Tycoon was released in 1994, Transport Tycoon Deluxe, and expanded and improved version, was released a year later.
TTDPatch, a third-party patch by Josef Drexler, was created some time after to address some of the bugs in TTD, but eventually branched out into adding numerous features and enhancements. While TTDPatch had changed the game quite radically, many desired features could not be added to TTD due to the method that TTDPatch modified the original game.[2]
In 2003, Ludvig Strigeus started reverse engineering TTD and converting the game to C. The first release of OpenTTD, version 0.1, was made available in 2004.
The current stable release of OpenTTD is version 0.7.0 with many new features including the long awaited PBS (Path based Signalling). Version 0.7.0 also includes a built in downloader for accessing the many alternate graphics files for the game. This includes the OpenGFX set which replaces all of the games graphics allowing OpenTTD to be played for the first time without any of the original graphics files. In effect now, for the first time, OpenTTD is its own game.

The game begins by default in the year 1950, though the starting date can be changed to any date where vehicles are available, including near-future dates with futuristic vehicles. The player starts by borrowing money to start their own transport company.The company then builds loading stations and transport routes which connect industries and towns, and then purchases vehicles to transport cargo and passengers. As more money is made, the company can afford to build more routes and eventually a transportation empire. Up to eight companies can participate in a game, and can be controlled by humans or the computer. The artificial intelligence of competitors was poor; however a new framework has been introduced for greatly improved computer players. Separate AIs can be downloaded directly from the game.[3]
There are four methods used to transport cargo: rail, road, air and sea. Each method has its own vehicles and stations to carry cargo. The stations each have ratings dependent on their efficiency; higher ratings attract more goods to a station. The game allows saving at any time, and multiple saves of a particular game at any point are possible.
Cargo (such as coal) is loaded at one station and delivered to another where there is demand (such as a power station). A profit is then awarded to the company. The amount of profit depends on delivery time, distance, amount delivered and type of cargo. For example, passengers require a quick delivery for a decent profit. Coal is less important and can be transported more slowly.
There are many tools available to build transport routes, including the ability to fully modify the landscape. Each town has a local authority which tries to prevent the player from performing excessive terraforming.
As the game progresses, new semi-realistic technology becomes available. For example, railroad signals are initially semaphores, and later switch to red and green traffic light signals. Initially, only steam locomotives are available, although diesel locomotives, electric locomotives, monorails and, finally, Mag-Lev trains become available. Over time, cities develop and expand according to economic factors and new industries or other resource sites appear. Some natural resources are eventually exhausted and industries without transport service may shut down.
The game ends at the year 2050 and records the company's achievement in the "hall of fame". To play the entire 100 years of the game from 1950 to 2050 takes about 25 hours of real time. The player can optionally continue playing indefinitely into the future, although no new technology arises.

Due to its use of Simple DirectMedia Layer cross-platform graphics and sound layers, OpenTTD can be compiled and run on many different operating systems, such as:[4]
