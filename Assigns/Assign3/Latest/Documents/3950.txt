Saffron
Saffron (pronounced /Ààs√¶fr…ôn/, /Ààs√¶fr…ín/) is a spice derived from the dried stigma of the flower of the saffron crocus (Crocus sativus), a species of crocus in the family Iridaceae. The flower has three stigmas, which are the distal ends of the plant's carpels. Together with its style, the stalk connecting the stigmas to the rest of the plant, these components are often dried and used in cooking as a seasoning and coloring agent. Saffron, which has for decades been the world's most expensive spice by weight,[1][2] is native to Southwest Asia.[2][3] Saffron is known as 'Kasubha' in The Philippines and St.John's, 'Kesar' in India, and 'Kong' in Kashmir, which is among the few places in the world where the spice grows.
Saffron is characterized by a bitter taste and an iodoform- or hay-like fragrance; these are caused by the chemicals picrocrocin and safranal.[4][5] It also contains a carotenoid dye, crocin, that gives food a rich golden-yellow hue. These traits make saffron a much-sought ingredient in many foods worldwide. Saffron also has medicinal applications.
The word saffron originated from the 12th-century Old French term safran, which derives from the Latin word safranum. Safranum is also related to the Italian zafferano and Spanish azafr√°n.[6] Safranum comes from the Arabic word a·π£far (ÿ£ŸéÿµŸíŸÅŸéÿ±‚Äé), which means "yellow," via the Persian paronymous za ªfarƒÅn (ÿ≤ŸéÿπŸíŸÅŸéÿ±ŸéÿßŸÜ‚Äé).[5][7]

The domesticated saffron crocus (C. sativus) is an autumn-flowering perennial plant unknown in the wild. It is a sterile triploid form, possibly of the eastern Mediterranean autumn-flowering Crocus cartwrightianus.[8], which originated in Crete, not, as was once generally believed, in Central Asia.[5] The saffron crocus resulted when C. cartwrightianus was subjected to extensive artificial selection by growers who desired elongated stigmas. Being sterile, the saffron crocus's purple flowers fail to produce viable seeds, thus, reproduction is dependent on human assistance: the corms (underground bulb-like starch-storing organs) must be manually dug up, broken apart, and replanted. A corm survives for only one season, reproducing via division into up to ten "cormlets" that eventually give rise to new plants.[8] The corms are small brown globules up to 4.5†centimetres (1.8†in) in diameter and are shrouded in a dense mat of parallel fibers.
After a period of aestivation in summer, five to eleven narrow and nearly vertical green leaves‚Äîgrowing up to 40†cm (16†in) in length, emerge from the ground. In autumn, purple buds appear. Only in October, after most other flowering plants have released their seeds, does it develop its brilliantly hued flowers, ranging from a light pastel shade of lilac to a darker and more striated mauve.[9] Upon flowering, it averages less than 30†cm (12†in) in height.[10] Inside each flower is a three-pronged style; in turn, each prong terminates with a crimson stigma 25‚Äì30†mm in length.[8]

The saffron crocus thrives in climates similar to that of the Mediterranean maquis or the North American chaparral, where hot, dry summer breezes blow across arid and semi-arid lands. Nevertheless, the plant can tolerate cold winters, surviving frosts as cold as ‚àí10†¬∞C (14†¬∞F) and short periods of snow cover.[11][8] However, if not grown in wet environments like Kashmir (where rainfall averages 1,000‚Äì1,500†mm annually), irrigation is needed‚Äîthis is true in the saffron-growing regions of Greece (500†mm of rainfall annually) and Spain (400†mm). Rainfall timing is also key: generous spring rains followed by relatively dry summers are optimal. In addition, rainfall occurring immediately prior to flowering also boosts saffron yields; nevertheless, rainy or cold weather occurring during flowering promotes disease, thereby reducing yields. Persistently damp and hot conditions also harm yields,[12] as do the digging actions of rabbits, rats, and birds. Parasites such as nematodes, leaf rusts, and corm rot also pose significant threats. Saffron plants grow best in strong and direct sunlight, and fare poorly in shady conditions. Thus, planting is best done in fields that slope towards the sunlight (i.e. south-sloping in the Northern Hemisphere), maximizing the crocuses' sun exposure. In the Northern Hemisphere, planting is mostly done in June, with corms planted some 7‚Äì15†cm deep. Planting depth and corm spacing‚Äîalong with climate‚Äîare both critical factors impacting plant yields. Thus, mother corms planted more deeply yield higher-quality saffron, although they produce fewer flower buds and daughter corms. With such knowledge, Italian growers have found that planting corms 15†centimetres (5.9†in) deep and in rows spaced 2‚Äì3†cm apart optimizes threads yields, whereas planting depths of 8‚Äì10†cm optimizes flower and corm production. Meanwhile, Greek, Moroccan, and Spanish growers have devised different depths and spacings to suit their own climates.
Saffron crocuses grow best in friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay-calcareous soils with high organic content. Raised beds are traditionally used to promote good drainage. Historically, soil organic content was boosted via application of some 20‚Äì30†tonnes of manure per hectare. Afterwards‚Äîand with no further manure application‚Äîcorms were planted.[13] After a period of dormancy through the summer, the corms send up their narrow leaves and begin to bud in early autumn. Only in mid-autumn do the plants begin to flower. Harvesting of flowers is by necessity a speedy affair: after their flowering at dawn, flowers quickly wilt as the day passes.[14] Furthermore, saffron crocuses bloom within a narrow window spanning one or two weeks.[15] Approximately 150 flowers yield 1†g of dry saffron threads; to produce 12†g of dried saffron (72†g freshly harvested), 1†kg of flowers are needed (1†lb for 0.2†oz of dried saffron). On average, one freshly picked flower yields 0.03†g of fresh saffron, or 0.007†g of dried saffron.[13]

Saffron contains more than 150 volatile and aroma-yielding compounds. It also has many nonvolatile active components,[17] many of which are carotenoids, including zeaxanthin, lycopene, and various Œ±- and Œ≤-carotenes. However, saffron's golden yellow-orange colour is primarily the result of Œ±-crocin. This crocin is trans-crocetin di-(Œ≤-D-gentiobiosyl) ester (systematic (IUPAC) name: 8,8-diapo-8,8-carotenoic acid). This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin.[17] Crocins themselves are a series of hydrophilic carotenoids that are either monoglycosyl or diglycosyl polyene esters of crocetin.[17] Meanwhile, crocetin is a conjugated polyene dicarboxylic acid that is hydrophobic, and thus oil-soluble. When crocetin is esterified with two water-soluble gentiobioses (which are sugars), a product results that is itself water-soluble. The resultant Œ±-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may comprise more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make Œ±-crocin ideal for colouring water-based (non-fatty) foods such as rice dishes.[18]
The bitter glucoside picrocrocin is responsible for saffron's flavour. Picrocrocin (chemical formula: C16H26O7; systematic name: 4-(Œ≤-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,6,6- trimethylcyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxaldehyde) is a union of an aldehyde sub-element known as safranal (systematic name: 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene-1- carboxaldehyde) and a carbohydrate. It has insecticidal and pesticidal properties, and may comprise up to 4% of dry saffron. Significantly, picrocrocin is a truncated version (produced via oxidative cleavage) of the carotenoid zeaxanthin and is the glycoside of the terpene aldehyde safranal. The reddish-coloured[19] zeaxanthin is, incidentally, one of the carotenoids naturally present within the retina of the human eye.
When saffron is dried after its harvest, the heat, combined with enzymatic action, splits picrocrocin to yield D-glucose and a free safranal molecule.[16] Safranal, a volatile oil, gives saffron much of its distinctive aroma.[4][20] Safranal is less bitter than picrocrocin and may comprise up to 70% of dry saffron's volatile fraction in some samples.[19] A second element underlying saffron's aroma is 2-hydroxy-4,4,6-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, the scent of which has been described as "saffron, dried hay like".[21] Chemists found this to be the most powerful contributor to saffron's fragrance despite its being present in a lesser quantity than safranal.[21] Dry saffron is highly sensitive to fluctuating pH levels, and rapidly breaks down chemically in the presence of light and oxidizing agents. It must therefore be stored away in air-tight containers in order to minimise contact with atmospheric oxygen. Saffron is somewhat more resistant to heat.
Crocus sativus has been shown to have antidepressant effects; two active ingredients are crocin and safranal.[22]

The history of saffron cultivation reaches back more than 3,000 years.[23] The wild precursor of domesticated saffron crocus was Crocus cartwrightianus. Human cultivators bred wild specimens by selecting for unusually long stigmas. Thus, a sterile mutant form of C. cartwrightianus, C. sativus, emerged in late Bronze Age Crete.[24] Experts believe saffron was first documented in a 7th century BC Assyrian botanical reference compiled under Ashurbanipal. Since then, documentation of saffron's use over the span of 4,000 years in the treatment of some 90 illnesses has been uncovered.[25]

Minoans portrayed saffron in their palace frescoes by 1500‚Äì1600 BC, showing saffron's use as a therapeutic drug.[26][27] Later, Greek legends told of sea voyages to Cilicia. There, adventurers hoped to procure what they believed was the world's most valuable saffron.[28] Another legend tells of Crocus and Smilax, whereby Crocus is bewitched and transformed into the original saffron crocus.[29] Ancient Mediterranean peoples‚Äîincluding perfumers in Egypt, physicians in Gaza, townspeople in Rhodes,[30] and the Greek hetaerae courtesans‚Äîused saffron in their perfumes, ointments,[31] potpourris, mascaras, divine offerings, and medical treatments.[31]
In late Hellenistic Egypt, Cleopatra used saffron in her baths so that lovemaking would be more pleasurable.[32] Egyptian healers used saffron as a treatment for all varieties of gastrointestinal ailments.[33] Saffron was also used as a fabric dye in such Levant cities as Sidon and Tyre.[34] Aulus Cornelius Celsus prescribes saffron in medicines for wounds, cough, colic, and scabies, and in the mithridatium.[35] Such was the Romans' love of saffron that Roman colonists took their saffron with them when they settled in southern Gaul, where it was extensively cultivated until Rome's fall. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th century AD Moors or with the Avignon papacy in the 14th century AD.[36]

Saffron-based pigments have been found in 50,000 year-old depictions of prehistoric beasts in what is today Iraq.[37][38]
