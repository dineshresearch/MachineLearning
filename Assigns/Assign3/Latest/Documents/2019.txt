List of poker hands
In poker, players construct hands of five cards according to predetermined rules, which vary according to the precise variant of poker being played. These hands are compared using a standard ranking system, and the player with the highest-ranking hand wins that particular deal. Although used primarily in poker, these hand rankings are also used in other card games, and with poker dice.
The strength of a hand is increased by having multiple cards of the same rank, all the cards being from the same suit, or having all the cards with consecutive values. The position of the various possible hands is based on the probability of being randomly dealt such a hand from a well-shuffled deck.

The following general rules apply to evaluating poker hands, whatever set of hand values are used.

For ease of recognition, poker hands are usually presented with the most important cards on the left, with cards descending in importance towards the right. However, a poker hand still has the same value however it is arranged. There are 311,875,200 ways (permutations) of being dealt five cards from a 52 card deck,[1] but since the order of cards does not matter there are  possible distinct hands (combinations).

A straight flush is a poker hand which contains five cards in sequence, all of the same suit, such as Qâ™£ Jâ™£ 10â™£ 9â™£ 8â™£. Two such hands are compared by their highest card; since suits have no relative value, two otherwise identical straight flushes tie (so 10â™£ 9â™£ 8â™£ 7â™£ 6â™£ ties with 10â™¥ 9â™¥ 8â™¥ 7â™¥ 6â™¥). Aces can play low in straights and straight flushes: 5â™¦ 4â™¦ 3â™¦ 2â™¦ Aâ™¦ is a 5-high straight flush, also known as a "steel wheel".[2][3] An ace-high straight flush such as Aâ™  Kâ™  Qâ™  Jâ™  10â™  is known as a royal flush, and is the highest ranking standard poker hand.
There are 40 possible straight flushes, including the four Royal Flushes. The probability of being dealt one of them is 

Four of a kind, also known as quads, is a poker hand such as 9â™£ 9â™  9â™¦ 9â™¥ Jâ™¥, which contains four cards of one rank, and an unmatched card of another rank. It ranks above a full house and below a straight flush. Higher ranking quads defeat lower ranking ones. In community-card games (such as Texas Hold 'em) or games with wildcards it is possible for two or more players to obtain the same quad; in this instance, the unmatched card acts as a kicker, so 7â™£ 7â™  7â™¦ 7â™¥ Jâ™¥ defeats 7â™£ 7â™  7â™¦ 7â™¥ 10â™£.
There are 624 possible hands including four of a kind; the probability of being dealt one is 

A full house, also known as a full boat, is a hand such as 3â™£ 3â™  3â™¦ 6â™£ 6â™¥, which contains three matching cards of one rank, and two matching cards of another rank. It ranks below a four of a kind and above a flush. Between two full houses, the one with the higher ranking set of three wins, so 7â™  7â™¥ 7â™¦ 4â™  4â™£ defeats 6â™  6â™¥ 6â™¦ Aâ™  Aâ™£. If two hands have the same set of three (possible in wild card and community card games), the hand with the higher pair wins, so 5â™¥ 5â™¦ 5â™  Qâ™¥ Qâ™£ defeats 5â™£ 5â™¦ 5â™  Jâ™  Jâ™¦. Full houses are described as "Three full of Pair" or occasionally "Three over Pair"; Qâ™£ Qâ™¦ Qâ™  9â™¥ 9â™£ could be described as "Queens over nines", "Queens full of nines", or simply "Queens full". However, "Queens over nines" is more commonly used to describe the hand containing two pairs, one pair of queens and one pair of nines, as in Qâ™  Qâ™¥ 9â™£ 9â™  Jâ™¦.
There are 3,744 possible full houses; the probability of being dealt one in a five-card hand is 


A flush is a poker hand such as Qâ™£ 10â™£ 7â™£ 6â™£ 4â™£, which contains five cards of the same suit, not in rank sequence. It ranks above a straight and below a full house. Two flushes are compared as if they were high card hands; the highest ranking card of each is compared to determine the winner. If both hands have the same highest card, then the second-highest ranking card is compared, and so on until a difference is found. If the two flushes contain the same five ranks of cards, they are tied â€“ suits are not used to differentiate them. Flushes are described by their highest card, as in "queen-high flush" to describe Qâ™¦ 9â™¦ 7â™¦ 4â™¦ 3â™¦. If the rank of the second card is important, it can also be included: Kâ™  10â™  5â™  3â™  2â™  is a "king-ten-high flush" or just a "king-ten flush", while Kâ™¥ Qâ™¥ 9â™¥ 5â™¥ 4â™¥ is a "king-queen-high flush".
There are 5,148 possible flushes, of which 40 are also straight flushes; the probability of being dealt a flush in a five-card hand is
