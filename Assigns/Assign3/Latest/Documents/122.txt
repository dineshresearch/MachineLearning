The Science of Sleep
The Science of Sleep (La Science des r√™ves, literally The Science of Dreams) is a 2006 French film, written and directed by Michel Gondry. The film stars Gael Garc√≠a Bernal, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Miou-Miou and Alain Chabat.

St√©phane (Gael Garc√≠a Bernal) is a young man whose vivid dreams and imagination often interfere with his ability to interact with reality. He is coaxed back to his childhood home after his divorced father passes away and his mother finds him a job in a calendar printing company in France. His mother implies the position is a creative role, and he prepares colourful drawings, each showing a disaster, for his "disasterology" calendar. However, nobody appreciates his talents and it transpires that his mother had led him on - the real vacancy is for nothing more than mundane typesetting work. While leaving his apartment to go to work one day, St√©phane injures his hand helping his new neighbor move a piano into her apartment. The new neighbor, St√©phanie (Charlotte Gainsbourg), invites St√©phane into her apartment (unaware that he lives next door) where her friend Zo√© (Emma de Caunes) tends to his wound. St√©phane initially forms an attraction to Zo√©, though he suspects it is instead St√©phanie who likes him.
St√©phane realizes that St√©phanie, like him, is creative and artistic. They plan a project for use in a short animated film. Following the advice of Guy (Alain Chabat), St√©phane's sex-obsessed co-worker, St√©phane pretends that he isn't St√©phanie's neighbor, pretending to leave the building when he leaves her apartment. That night, when he is sleepwalking he writes a confusing note to St√©phanie that asks for Zo√©'s phone number. St√©phane realizes his mistake upon waking and retrieves the letter with a coat hanger, unaware that St√©phanie has already read it.
Surrealistic and naturalistic elements begin to overlap, and the viewer is often uncertain of which portions constitute reality and which are merely dreams. One such sequence, in which St√©phane dreams his hands become absurdly giant, was inspired by a recurring nightmare director Michel Gondry had as a child.[3] St√©phane becomes more enamoured with St√©phanie as he spends more time with her and shares his many inventions with her. He gives her a "one-second time machine". He asks her repeatedly if she will marry him, despite her consistent rejections. St√©phane's dreams encroach on his waking life as he tries to win St√©phanie's heart and misses time at work. He breaks into St√©phanie's apartment, takes her small, stuffed horse toy and implants a galloping mechanism. While putting it back into her apartment, St√©phanie arrives and catches him, shocked, calling him "creepy." Embarrassed and heartbroken, St√©phane retreats to his apartment where he receives a call from St√©phanie who apologizes and thanks him for the gift she discovers: a galloping version of "Golden the Pony Boy," named after St√©phane.
Waking and dreaming become even more intermixed. To St√©phane's surprise, the calendar manufacturer accepts his "Disastrology" idea and it becomes a great success. A party is thrown in his honour, but he becomes depressed and begins drinking excessively after he witnesses St√©phanie dancing flirtatiously with another man. St√©phane and St√©phanie then have a confrontation in their hallway when St√©phane announces that he doesn't want to be St√©phanie's friend any longer. St√©phanie becomes very upset, offering Zo√©'s phone number and reciting St√©phane's note. St√©phane, still unaware that St√©phanie has read the note, assumes that they are connected through "Parallel Synchronized Randomness", a rare phenomenon he has examined in his dreams. St√©phanie offers that they discuss their issues on a date, but on St√©phane's walk to the caf√© to meet her, he has a frightful vision that she isn't there and she doesn't love him. He runs back to her apartment and bangs on her door, demanding that she stop torturing him, though, in actuality, she is indeed waiting for him at the caf√©. Tired of waiting, St√©phanie returns home. St√©phane finally decides that he's had enough and prepares to return to Mexico.
Before leaving, St√©phane's mother (Miou-Miou) insists that he say goodbye to St√©phanie. In his attempt to do so, he becomes extremely crass as he makes sexual jokes, and accuses her of never being able to finish something she starts. Yet he reveals that he is truly interested in her because she's different from other people. St√©phane spots two items on her bedside: his one-second time machine, and the boat with the forest inside of it - finished. He falls asleep on her bed as St√©phanie watches him and gently strokes his hair. St√©phane dreams of himself and St√©phanie riding on Golden the Pony Boy and sailing off into the ocean's horizon on the white boat.

The score to The Science of Sleep was composed by Jean-Michel Bernard.
The song "Instinct Blues" by the The White Stripes is featured in the film.[4] The sequence where a band of people, dressed as cats, play the song "If You Rescue Me", parodies the song "After Hours" by the Velvet Underground
