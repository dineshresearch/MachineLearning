Electroclash
Electroclash, sometimes alternatively spelled as Elektroklash, is a style of music that fuses New Wave and electronic dance music. Larry Tee coined the term, but DJ Hell from Gigolo Records is also often regarded as one of the pioneers of the genre.[1][2]
Artists associated with electroclash include Felix da Housecat, Freezepop, Miss Kittin and The Hacker, Tiga,[3] Peaches, Le Tigre, Chicks on Speed,[4] Fischerspooner, The Slants and Ladytron.[5] The aesthetic is often associated with the 1982 film Liquid Sky.[6]

The term "Electroclash" first rose to media attention in 2001, when the Electroclash festival was held in New York.[7] This music was a reaction against current electronic music, in favor of an artistic underground movement.[8] These bands took inspiration from New Wave and modern art, and produced a synthesized pop sound. Many of these bands played at art galleries instead of traditional clubs. The artists that initially received the most media attention were Fischerspooner, Peaches, Chicks on Speed, and Miss Kittin and The Hacker. The song that many have thought given the nu-electro sound or blueprint (and a big inspiration to Fischerspooner according to Warren Fischer of the group) was I-f's "Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass". The genre had a peak of interest between 2002 and 2004, when many media outlets were focusing on it.[9] Some media outlets heavily promoted the genre in the beginning. Due to this, some people criticized the genre, claiming that it is without substance or that it was created by the media, and often use humor in these criticisms.[10] The Electroclash festival was originally held in 2001 and was held again in 2002 with subsequent live tours across the US and Europe in 2003 and 2004. The festivals have included performances by Scissor Sisters, Felix Da Housecat, Peaches (musician), Fischerspooner, Chicks On Speed, 2 Many DJs, DJ Erol Alkan, Princess Superstar,Mignon (musician), W.I.T., Tommie Sunshine, Crossover, Mount Sims, A.R.E, Weapons, BIS, Avenue D, My Robot Friend, Lawrence Casal,Soviet, and many more. Though popular focus on the genre has died down recently,[5] many of the artists who came from it are still producing music.[11] The Guardian called electroclash and minimalist techno "two of the most significant upheavals in recent dance music history."[12]
