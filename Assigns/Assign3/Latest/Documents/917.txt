GIMP
GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program, previously General Image Manipulation Program) is a free software, raster graphics editor used to process digital graphics and photographs. Typical uses include creating graphics and logos, resizing and cropping photos, altering colors, combining multiple images, removing unwanted image components, and converting between different image formats.[2] Along with these uses, GIMP is widely used as a tool for photo enhancement. GIMP can also be used to create basic animated images in GIF format. It is often used as a replacement for Adobe Photoshop, the most widely used bitmap editor in the printing and graphics industries; however, it is not designed to be a Photoshop clone.[3] The project's mascot is named Wilber.
The project was started in 1995 by Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis and is now maintained by a group of volunteers under the auspices of the GNOME Project.[4] The current version of GIMP works with numerous operating systems, including most Unix variants, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, GIMP is free software.

GIMP's manipulation tools can be accessed via the toolbox, menu paths, and dialog boxes (which can be grouped in docks). They include filters and brushes, as well as transformation, selection, layer and masking tools.

GIMP also has a palette with RGB, HSV, color wheel, CMYK, and mixing modes, plus tools to pick colors from the image with various averaging options. There is support for hexadecimal color codes (as used in HTML). "CMYK" colors are immediately translated into RGB when used; GIMP does not have any built-in support for CMYK mixtures that cannot be represented in RGB, such as rich blacks, though they can be simulated to a limited extent with third-party add-ons.[citation needed]
GIMP supports gradients, which integrate into its other tools (such as brushes and fills) to shade image areas with automated color blending. It includes a variety of built-in gradients, and as with the brushes, also allows the user to customize and create their own gradient fills.

GIMP can perform rectangular or circular selection, freehand selection, and "by color" selection. Alternatively, the Smart Selection tool, known as the "Magic Wand", can be used to select contiguous regions. The Intelligent Scissors (iScissors) tool can be used to auto-create paths between regions defined by strong color-changes. the 'Foreground select' tool is available since 2.4 uses Simple Interactive Object Extraction (SIOX) to select an object in the foreground with some few mouse strokes by the user.
GIMP has support for layers, including transparent layers, which can be shown, hidden, or made semitransparent. It also supports transparent and semitransparent images. Channels add different types of opacity and color effects to images.

Paths containing line segments or BÃ©zier curves can be created using the Path tool. Paths can be named, saved, and painted (or "stroked") with brushes, patterns, or various line styles. Paths can also be used to create complex selections.

GIMP has approximately 150 standard effects and filters, including Drop Shadow, Blur, Motion blur and Noise.
GIMP operations can be automated with scripting languages. The Script-Fu extension language based on Scheme is built in (originally SIOD but switched to TinyScheme as of GIMP 2.4.), and external Perl, Python, or Tcl can be used. Ruby support is in experimental development. These scripts and plugins for GIMP can be used interactively, or combined non-interactively.

GIMP is primarily developed by unpaid volunteers. The GIMP project has a development branch of GIMP where new features are added regularly and a stable branch which only receives bug fixes between major versions. Adopting a scheme used by many other free software projects, the stable and development branches are denoted with even and odd numbers respectively after the first decimal point in the version number. The old series last version is 2.4.7. The current stable version of GIMP is 2.6.5 (as of Feb. 16, 2009.) Major changes from version 1.2 to version 2.2 included a more polished user interface, further separation of the user interface and back-end and the ability to use brushes that would normally only be able to be used on Photoshop programs. Major changes from version 2.2 to version 2.4 included color management support, scalable brushes, new and rewritten selection tools and overall user interface changes.[5], Major changes from version 2.4 to version 2.6 included a new layout of windows and tool palettes, new brush dynamics features, basic integration of the General Graphical Library (though users won't see any effect by default), improved free selection tool and a new PSD import plug-in that can read ICC color profiles.[6] The use of GEGL addresses some fundamental design limitations of the previous version that prevented many enhancements such as native CMYK support.
GIMP's user interface is built using GTK+, a widget toolkit originally written for the program. GTK+, as the GIMP Toolkit, was initially a part of the GIMP source tree, but has since been refactored due to its usefulness outside the scope of GIMP. GTK+ is also used as the widget toolkit for the GNOME desktop environment. GTK+ was intended as a replacement for Motif, a proprietary toolkit on which GIMP originally depended. GIMP and GTK+ were originally designed for the X Window System running on Unix-like operating systems, but have since been ported to Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and SkyOS.

GIMP originally stood for General Image Manipulation Program.[7] Its creators, Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis, began developing GIMP as a semester-long project at the University of California, Berkeley in 1995.[8] The name was changed to the GNU Image Manipulation Program in 1997, after Kimball and Mattis had graduated, when it became an official part of the GNU Project.[9]

GIMP 0.54 was released in January 1996.[10][11] It required X11 displays, an X-server that supported the X shared memory extension and Motif 1.2 widgets. It supported 8, 15, 16 and 24-bit color depths, dithering for 8-bit displays and could view images as rgb color, grayscale or indexed color. It could simultaneously edit multiple images, zoom and pan in real-time, and supported GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF and XPM images.[7]
Even at this early stage of development GIMP functionality was extensive. It could select regions using rectangle, ellipse, free, fuzzy, bezier, and intelligent selection tools, and rotate, scale, shear and flip images. It had bucket, brush and airbrush painting tools, and could clone, convolve, and blend images. It had text tools, effects filters (such as blur and edge detect), and channel and color operations (such as add, composite, decompose). The plugin system allowed for addition of new file formats and new effect filters. It supported multiple undo and redo operations.[7]
It ran on Linux 1.2.13, Solaris 2.4, HP-UX 9.05, and SGI IRIX operating systems.[7] It was rapidly adopted by users,[12][13] who created tutorials, displayed artwork and shared techniques.[10][11] An early success for GIMP was the Linux penguin Tux, as drawn by Larry Ewing using Gimp 0.54.[14] By July 5, 1996 the volume of messages posted to the mailing list had risen and the mailing list was split into two lists, gimp-developer and gimp-user. Currently, user questions are directed to the gimpnet IRC channel.[10][11]

GIMP 0.60 was released on June 6, 1997[15] using the GNU General Public License.[16] According to the release notes, Peter Mattis was working for Hewlett-Packard and Spencer Kimball was working as a Java programmer.[17]
GIMP 0.60 no longer depended on the Motif toolkit. Improvements had been made to the painting tools, airbrush, channel operations, palettes, blend tool modes, image panning and transformation tools. The editing work flow was improved by enabling rulers, cutting and pasting between all image types, cloning between all image types and ongoing development of a layers dialog.
New tools included new brushes (and a new brush file format), grayscale and RGB transparency,"Bucket fill" patterns and a pattern selection dialog, integrated paint modes, border, feather and color selectors, a pencil and eraser paint tool, gamma adjustments and a limited layer move tool.
The new widgets were managed by Peter Mattis and were called GTK for GIMP toolkit and GDK for GIMP drawing kit.[17]

The biggest change in the GIMP 0.99 release was in the GIMP toolkit (GTK). GTK was redesigned to be object oriented and renamed from GTK to GTK+. The pace of development slowed when Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis found employment.[10][11]

GIMP 1.0.0 was released on June 2, 1998[18] GIMP and GTK+ split into separate projects during the GIMP 1.0 release. GIMP 1.0 included a new tile based memory management system which enabled editing of larger images and a change in the plug-in API (Application programming interface) allowed scripts to be safely called from other scripts and to be self documenting. GIMP 1.0 also introduced a native file format (xcf) with support for layers, guides and selections (active channels).
An official website was constructed for GIMP during the 1.0 series, designed by Adrian Likins and Jens Lautenbacher, now found at classic.gimp.org which provided introductory tutorials and additional resources.[19] On April 13, 1997, GIMP News was started by Zach Beane, a site that announced plug-ins, tutorials and articles written about GIMP. May 1997, Seth Burgess started GIMP Bugs, the first 'electronic bug list'.[10][11]
Marc Lehmann[20] developed a perl scripting plug-in.[21][22][23] Web interfaces were possible with the GIMP 1.0 series, and GIMP Net-fu[24] can still be used for online graphics generation.[25]

The GIMP 1.1 series focused on fixing bugs and porting to Windows. No official release occurred during this series. Following this the odd numbered series (eg 1.1) of GIMP releases were considered unstable development releases and even numbered releases (eg 1.2) were considered stable releases. By this time, GTK+ had become a significant project and many of GIMP's original developers turned to GTK+ development. These included Owen Taylor (author of GIMP ifsCompose),[26] Federico Mena,[27] Tim Janik,[28] Shawn Amundson and others. GNOME also attracted GIMP developers. The primary GIMP developers during this period were Manish Singh, Michael Natterer[29] Sven Neumann[30] and Tor Lillqvist[30] who primarily fixed issues so that GIMP could run on Win32.[31]

GIMP 1.2.0 was released on December 25, 2000. GIMP 1.2 had a new development team of Manish Singh, Sven Neumann and Mitch Natterer and others. GIMP 1.2 offered internationalization options, improved installation dialogs, many bug fixes (in GIMP and GTK+), overhauled plug-ins, reduced memory leaks and reorganized menus.[32] New plug-ins included GIMPressionist, Sphere Designer, by Vidar Madsen,[33] Image Map by Maurits Rijk[34] GFlare by Eiichi Takamori, Warp by John P. Beale, Stephen Robert Norris and Federico Mena Quintero, Sample Colorize and Curve Bend by Wolfgang Hofer. New tools included a new path tool, a new airbrush tool, a resizable toolbox, enhanced pressure support, a measure tool, dodge, burn and smudge tools. New functionality included image pipes, jpeg save preview, a new image navigation window, scaled brush previews, selection to path, drag'n'drop, quickmask, a help browser, tear-off menus and the waterselect plug-in was integrated into the color-selector.[32]
The 1.2 series was the final GIMP 1 series.

GIMP 2.0.0 was released on March 23, 2004. The biggest visible change was the transition to the GTK+ 2.x toolkit.

Major revisions in interface and tools were made available with the GIMP 2.4.0 release on October 24, 2007. Rewritten selection tools, use of the Tango style guidelines for a polished UI on all platforms, a foreground selection tool, and support for the ABR brush filetype along with the ability to resize brushes were some of the many updates.

More major revisions in interface and tools were made available with the 2.6.0 release on October 1, 2008. There were big changes in the UI, free sel
