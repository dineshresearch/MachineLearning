Richard Nixon
Richard Milhous Nixon (January 9, 1913 – April 22, 1994) was the 37th President of the United States (1969–1974) and the only president to resign the office. He was also the 36th Vice President of the United States (1953–1961).
Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, California. After completing undergraduate work at Whittier College, he graduated from Duke University School of Law in 1937 and returned to California to practice law in La Mirada. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he joined the United States Navy and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander during World War II. He was elected in 1946 as a Republican to the House of Representatives representing California's 12th Congressional district, and in 1950 to the United States Senate. He was chosen by Republican Party nominee Dwight D. Eisenhower to be his running mate in 1952 and served as vice president from 1953 until 1961. Despite announcing his retirement from politics after losing the 1960 presidential election and 1962 California gubernatorial election, Nixon was elected to the presidency in 1968.
The most immediate task facing President Nixon was the Vietnam War. He initially escalated the conflict, overseeing secret bombing campaigns, but soon withdrew American troops and successfully negotiated a ceasefire with North Vietnam, effectively ending American involvement in the war. His foreign policy was largely successful; he opened relations with the People's Republic of China and initiated détente with the Soviet Union. Domestically, he implemented new economic policies which called for wage and price control and the abolition of the gold standard. He was reelected by a landslide in 1972. In his second term, the nation was afflicted with economic difficulties. In the face of likely impeachment for his role in the Watergate scandal,[1] Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974. His successor, Gerald Ford, issued a pardon for any federal crimes Nixon may have committed while in office.
In his retirement, Nixon became a prolific author and undertook many foreign trips. Though far from universally popular, he gained respect as an elder statesman. He suffered a stroke on April 18, 1994, and died four days later at the age of 81.

Richard Nixon was born on January 9, 1913, to Francis A. Nixon and Hannah Milhous Nixon in a house his father had built in Yorba Linda, California.[2][3][4][5] His mother was a Quaker, and his upbringing is said to have been marked by conservative Quaker observances of the time, such as refraining from drinking, dancing, and swearing. His father converted from Methodism to Quakerism after his marriage.[4] Nixon had four brothers: Harold (1909–1933), Donald (1914–1987), Arthur (1918–1925), and Ed (born 1930).[6]
Nixon's early life was marked by hardships. Two of his brothers died before he was 21 and his family's ranch failed in 1922. The Nixons then moved to Whittier, California, the home of his mother's relatives, where his father opened a grocery store.[6]
Nixon initially attended Fullerton High School in Fullerton, but later transferred to Whittier High School, where he graduated second in his class in 1930. Financial concerns forced him to decline a scholarship to Harvard University[7] and to Yale University;[8] he instead enrolled at Whittier College,[9] a local Quaker school, where he co-founded a fraternity known as The Orthogonian Society. Nixon was a formidable debater, standout in collegiate drama productions, student body president, player on the football and basketball teams, and track runner.[9][10] While at Whittier, he lived at home and worked at his family's store;[9] he also taught Sunday school at East Whittier Friends Church, where he remained a member all his life. In 1934, he graduated second in his class from Whittier, and went on to Duke University School of Law, where he received a full scholarship.[9] His future plans at this time focused solely on law; he was elected president of the Duke Bar Association[11] and graduated third in his class in June 1937.[9]

Although Nixon's first choice was to get a job with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, he returned to California and was admitted to the bar in 1937. He began practicing with Wingert and Bewley,[9] where he worked on commercial litigation for local petroleum companies and other corporate matters as well as on wills.
By his own admission, Nixon would not work on divorce because he was "severely embarrassed by women's confessions of sexual misconduct." Nixon found the practice of law unexciting, but thought that it would gain him experience that would be beneficial in a future political career.[12] In 1938, he opened up his own branch of Wingert and Bewley in La Habra, California,[13] and the following year he became a full partner in the firm.[14]

In January 1938 Nixon was cast in the Whittier Community Players production of The Dark Tower. There he played opposite a high school teacher named Thelma "Pat" Ryan.[9][15] Nixon pursued her, but initially Ryan was not interested in a relationship. He began dropping in on her at her house unannounced and would take her on Sunday drives to the Quaker Sunday School where he was again teacher.[16] After several proposals, Ryan eventually agreed to marry the future president and they wed at a small ceremony on June 21, 1940.[9]
After a honeymoon in Mexico, the Nixons moved to Long Beach, then settled into an apartment in East Whittier a few months later.[17] In January 1942, they moved to Washington, D.C., where Richard Nixon took a job at the Office of Price Administration.[9]

Nixon was eligible for an exemption from military service, both as a Quaker with Quaker parents and through his job working for the OPA, but he did not seek one and was commissioned into the United States Navy in August 1942.[9] He was trained at Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island and was assigned to Ottumwa Naval Air Station, Iowa, for seven months. He was subsequently reassigned as the naval passenger control officer for the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command, supporting the logistics of operations in the South West Pacific theater.[18][19] After requesting more challenging duties he was given command of cargo handling units.[20] Nixon returned to the United States with two service stars (although he saw no actual combat) and a citation of commendation, and became the administrative officer of the Alameda Naval Air Station.[21] In January 1945 he was transferred to Philadelphia's Bureau of Aeronautics office to help negotiate the termination of war contracts. There he received another letter of commendation, this time from Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal. In October 1945, he was promoted to lieutenant commander.[21] He resigned his commission on New Year's Day 1946.[22]


Soon after World War II ended some Whittier Republicans approached Nixon about running for a seat in the United States House of Representatives.[23] Nixon accepted, and defeated five term Democratic incumbent Jerry Voorhis in the November 1946 election to represent southern California's 12th Congressional district.[23] He helped finance the campaign with his World War II poker winnings.[24]
In Congress, Nixon supported the Taft-Hartley Act of 1948, and served on the Education and Labor Committee.[23] He was part of the Herter Committee, which went to Europe to prepare a preliminary report on the newly enacted Marshall Plan.[23]
Nixon first gained national attention in 1948 when his investigation on the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) broke the impasse of the Alger Hiss spy case. Nixon believed Whittaker Chambers' allegations that Hiss, a high State Department official, was a Soviet spy. He discovered that Chambers saved microfilm reproductions of incriminating documents by hiding the film in a pumpkin; these became known as the "Pumpkin Papers".[25] They were alleged to be accessible only to Hiss and to have been typed on his personal typewriter. Hiss was convicted of perjury in 1950 for statements he made to the HUAC. The discovery that Hiss, who had been an adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, could have been a Soviet spy thrust Nixon into the public eye and made him a hero to many of Roosevelt's enemies, and an enemy to many of Roosevelt's supporters. In reality, his support for internationalism put him closer to the center of the Republican party. This case turned the young Congressman into a national, and controversial, figure.[23] Due to his popularity, Nixon was easily reelected in 1948.[23]

In the 1950 mid-term elections, Nixon challenged and defeated Democratic Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas in a landslide to win a seat in the United States Senate.[26] The campaign was very contentious. Nixon felt the former actress was a left-wing sympathizer and said she was "pink right down to her underwear."[26] Douglas responded by bestowing upon Nixon the nickname "Tricky Dick."[26]
As a senator, Nixon took a prominent position in opposing global communism. He traveled frequently, speaking out against what he labeled as "the threat."[26] He also criticized what he saw as President Harry S. Truman's mishandling of the Korean War.[26] He supported statehood for Alaska and Hawaii, voted in favor of civil rights, and favored disaster relief for India and Yugoslavia.[27] He voted against price and other controls, illegal immigration, and public power.[27]

Due to his anti-communist stance, the 39-year-old Nixon was selected by Republican party nominee General Dwight D. Eisenhower to be the Vice Presidential candidate at the Republican National Convention in July 1952.[28] In September, the New York Post produced an article claiming that campaign donors were buying influence with Nixon by providing him with a secret cash fund for his personal expenses.[28] Nixon responded by saying that the fund was not secret and produced an independent audit showing that it was used only for political purposes.[28] Republicans, including those within Eisenhower's campaign, pressured Eisenhower to remove Nixon from the ticket, but Eisenhower realized he was unlikely to win without Nixon.[29]
Nixon appeared on television on September 23, 1952 to defend himself, in a famous speech. He provided a
