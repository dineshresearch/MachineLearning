BedZED
Beddington Zero Energy Development (BedZED) is an environmentally-friendly-housing development near Wallington, England, in the London Borough of Sutton. It was designed by the architect Bill Dunster, who was looking for a more sustainable way of building housing in urban areas. The project was a partnership among BioRegional, Bill Dunster Architects the Peabody Trust, Arup and the cost consultants Gardiner and Theobald. The 99 homes, and 1,405 square metres of work space were built in 2000–2002. The project was shortlisted for the Stirling Prize in 2003.

BedZED is accessible from the east side of London Road (A237), opposite New Road, approximately 500 metres north of Hackbridge station. Because of BedZED's low-energy-emission concept, cars are discouraged; the project encourages public transport, cycling, and walking, and has limited parking space.
The development is within about five minutes walk of Hackbridge station, which services trains from London Victoria and St Pancras International via London Blackfriars. There is a Tramlink service from Croydon or Wimbledon to Mitcham Junction station, which is within 15 minutes walk of BedZED.
BedZED is serviced by the 127 bus on the Purley–Tooting route, via Wallington railway station and Hackbridge.


Monitoring conducted in 2003 [1] found that BedZED had achieved these reductions in comparison to UK averages:
