She teaches sex and relationship workshops around the world and provides private coaching sessions for individuals and couples.
In 2006 she appeared as a so-called "sextra" in John Cameron Mitchell's film, Shortbus, participating in an unsimulated orgy that was filmed for the movie. (Her presence is confirmed by the director on the DVD commentary).

Tristan on her sexuality, "I don't really identify with the label 'bisexual,' nor does it feel like it accurately describes me...I see myself as queer, since queer to me is not just about who I love or lust, but it's about my culture, my community, and my politics. The truth is, even if I were with a heterosexual guy, I'd be a queer dyke." [3]
Tristan stated in an online interview, "I identify strongly as queer and as a dyke, because, as I have said before, it's not just about who I fuck and love, being queer is also about my politics, my culture, my community, and the way I see the world. People want to call me bisexual or pansexual or whatever, but I believe in people's power to self-identity."[4]
In addition, "she describes herself as "equal opportunity." She doesn't like the word "bisexual" -- it's too polarizing."[5]
In addition to being a vocal advocate of nonmonogamy, Tristan supports gay marriage: "I support gay marriage being legalised in every state. I do however think itâ€™s unfortunate that in some cases gay marriage opponents have used the issue against polyamory."[6]
