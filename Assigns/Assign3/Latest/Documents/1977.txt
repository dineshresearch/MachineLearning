Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn (IPA: /so äl í…ôÀàniÀêts…®n/[1] Russian: –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞ÃÅ–Ω–¥—Ä –ò—Å–∞ÃÅ–µ–≤–∏—á –°–æ–ª–∂–µ–Ω–∏ÃÅ—Ü—ã–Ω, Russian pronunciation: […êl ≤…™Ààksandr …™Ààsa…™v ≤…™t…ï s…ôl ê…®Ààn ≤its…®n]) (December 11, 1918†‚Äì August 3, 2008)[2] was a Russian novelist, dramatist and historian. Through his writings, he made the world aware of the Gulag, the Soviet Union's forced labour camp system, and for these efforts Solzhenitsyn was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1974. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1970. He returned to Russia in 1994. He was the father of Ignat Solzhenitsyn, a conductor and pianist.



Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was born in Kislovodsk, RSFSR (now in Stavropol Krai, Russia) to a young Ukrainian[3] widow, Taisiya Solzhenitsyna (n√©e Shcherbak), whose father had risen, it seems, from humble beginnings, much of a self-made man, and acquired a large estate in the Kuban region by the northern foothills of the Caucasus. During World War I, Taisiya went to Moscow to study. While there she met Isaakiy Solzhenitsyn, a young army officer, also from the Caucasus region (the family background of his parents is vividly brought alive in the opening chapters of August 1914, and later on in the Red Wheel novel cycle).
In 1918, Taisia became pregnant with Aleksandr. Shortly after this was confirmed, Isaakiy was killed in a hunting accident. Aleksandr was raised by his widowed mother and aunt in lowly circumstances; his earliest years coincided with the Russian Civil War; by 1930 the family property had been turned into a collective farm. Solzhenitsyn stated his mother was fighting for survival and they had to keep his father's background in the old Imperial Army a secret. His educated mother (who never remarried) encouraged his literary and scientific learnings and raised him in the Russian Orthodox faith;[4] she died in 1944[5].
Solzhenitsyn studied mathematics at Rostov State University, while at the same time taking correspondence courses from the Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History (at this time heavily ideological in scope; as he himself makes clear, he did not question the state ideology or the superiority of the Soviet Union before he had spent some time in the camps). On April 7, 1940, while at the university, Solzhenitsyn married a chemistry student Natalia Alekseevna Reshetovskaya.[6] They divorced in 1952 (a year before his release from the Gulag); he remarried her in 1957[7] and they divorced again in 1972. The following year he married his second wife, Natalia Dmitrievna Svetlova, a mathematician who had a son from a brief prior marriage.[8] He and Svetlova (b. 1939) had three sons: Yermolai (1970), Ignat (1972) and Stepan (1973).[9]

During World War II Solzhenitsyn served as the commander of a sound-ranging battery in the Red Army,[10] was involved in major action at the front, and twice decorated.

In February 1945, while serving in East Prussia, Solzhenitsyn was arrested for writing derogatory comments in letters to a friend, Nikolai Vitkevich,[11] about the conduct of the war by Joseph Stalin, whom he called "the whiskered one,"[12] "Khozyain" ("the master") and "Balabos", (Odessa Yiddish for "the master").[13] He was accused of anti-Soviet propaganda under Article 58 paragraph 10 of the Soviet criminal code, and of "founding a hostile organization" under paragraph 11.[14] Solzhenitsyn was taken to the Lubyanka prison in Moscow, where he was beaten and interrogated. On July 7, 1945, he was sentenced in his absence by Special Council of the NKVD to an eight-year term in a labour camp. This was the normal sentence for most crimes under Article 58 at the time.[15]
The first part of Solzhenitsyn's sentence was served in several different work camps; the "middle phase," as he later referred to it, was spent in a sharashka, special scientific research facilities run by Ministry of State Security, where he met Lev Kopelev, upon whom he based the character of Lev Rubin in his book The First Circle, published in the West in 1968. In 1950, he was sent to a "Special Camp" for political prisoners. During his imprisonment at the camp in the town of Ekibastuz in Kazakhstan, he worked as a miner, bricklayer and foundry foreman. His experiences at Ekibastuz formed the basis for the book One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. While there he had a tumor removed, although his cancer was not then diagnosed.
In March 1953 after the expiry of Solzhenitsyn's sentence, he was sent to internal exile for life at Kok-Terek in southern Kazakhstan, as was common for political prisoners. His undiagnosed cancer spread, until, by the end of the year, he was close to death. However, in 1954, he was permitted to be treated in a hospital in Tashkent, where his tumor went into remission. These experiences became the basis of his novel Cancer Ward and also found an echo in the short story "The right hand." It was during this decade of imprisonment and exile that Solzhenitsyn abandoned Marxism and developed the philosophical and religious positions of his later life; this turn has some interesting parallels to Dostoevsky's time in Siberia and his quest for faith a hundred years earlier. Solzhenitsyn gradually turned into a philosophically-minded man in prison. He repented for what he did as a Red Army captain and in prison compared himself with the perpetrators of the Gulag: "I remember myself in my captain's shoulder boards and the forward march of my battery through East Prussia, enshrouded in fire, and I say: 'So were we any better?'" His transformation is described at some length in the fourth part of The Gulag Archipelago ("The Soul and Barbed Wire").

After Khrushchev's Secret Speech in 1956 Solzhenitsyn was freed from exile and exonerated. After his return to European Russia, Solzhenitsyn was, while teaching at a secondary school during the day, spending his nights secretly engaged in writing. In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech he wrote, "during all the years until 1961, not only was I convinced I should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime, but, also, I scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything I had written because I feared this would become known."[16]
Finally, when he was 42 years old, he approached Alexander Tvardovsky, a poet and the chief editor of the Noviy Mir magazine, with the manuscript of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. It was published in edited form in 1962, with the explicit approval of Nikita Khrushchev, who defended it and declared at the presidium of the Politburo hearing on whether to allow its publishing, "There‚Äôs a Stalinist in each of you; there‚Äôs even a Stalinist in me. We must root out this evil". The book became an instant hit and sold-out everywhere. During Khruschev's tenure, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich was studied in schools in the Soviet Union and three more novellas of Solzhenitsyn's were published in 1963. These would be the last of his works published in the Soviet Union until 1990.
One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich brought the Soviet system of prison labour to the attention of the West. It caused as much a sensation in the Soviet Union as it did the West‚Äînot only by its striking realism and candour, but also because it was the first major piece of Soviet literature since the twenties on a politically charged theme, written by a non-party member, even by a man who had been to Siberia for "libelous speech" about the leaders, and still it had not been censored. In this sense, the publication of Solzhenitsyn's story was an almost unheard of instance of free, unrestrained discussion of politics through literature. Most Soviet readers realized this, but after Khrushchev had been ousted from power in 1964, the time for such raw exposing works came quietly, but perceptibly, to a close.

Solzhenitsyn's work and political views provoked controversy in some countries. In response to the publishing of "Gulag Archipelago", critics in Russia called Solzhenitsyn a literary Vlasovite and accused him of having sided with Vlasov's men. [17]
In his literature, Solzhenitsyn was accused of having been a remained a sympathizer with Russia's enemies. Critics charged that in the book August 1914, Solzhenitsyn shows regret that the Germans failed to conquer Russia. According to critics, Solzhenitsyn shows admiration and kneeling before German militarism. A lengthy article in a Bulgarian newspaper charged Solzhenitsyn for being an apologist for German militarism.
Solzhenitsyn was criticized in the West for urging the United States to continue bombing Vietnam, opposing Amnesty International as too liberal, and for supporting General Franco's fascist regime. His consistency was questioned for "condemning the gulags but justifying napalm on Vietnam." [18]

Solzhenitsyn did not give in but tried, with the help of Tvardovsky, to get his novel, The Cancer Ward, legally published in the Soviet Union. This had to get the approval of the Union of Writers, and though some there appreciated it, the work ultimately was denied publication unless it was to be revised and cleaned of suspect statements and anti-Soviet insinuations (this episode is recounted and documented in The Oak and the Calf).
The publishing of his work quickly stopped; as a writer, he became a non-person, and, by 1965, the KGB had seized some of his papers, including the manuscript of The First Circle. Meanwhile Solzhenitsyn continued to secretly and feverishly work upon the most subversive of all his writings, the monumental Gulag Archipelago. The seizing of his novel manuscript first made him desperate and frightened, but gradually he realized that it had set him free from the pretenses and trappings of being an "officially acclaimed" writer, something which had come close to second nature, but which was becoming increasingly irrelevant (the circumstances of how he actually survived in this period without any income from his books are obscure; he had quit his teaching post when he broke through as a writer).
After the KGB had confiscated Solzhenitsyn's materials in Moscow, during 1965-1967 the preparatory drafts of The Gulag Archipelago were turned into finished typescript in hiding at his friends homes in Estonia. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had befriended Arnold Susi, a lawyer and former Estonian Minister of Education in a Lubyanka Prison cell. After completion the original Solzhenitsyn's handwritten script was kept hidden from the KGB in Estonia by Arnold Susi's daughter Heli Susi until the collapse of the Soviet Union.[19] [20]
In 1969 Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the Union of Writers. In 1970, Solzhenitsyn was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. He could not receive the prize personally in Stockholm at that time, since he was afraid he would not be let back into the Soviet Union. Instead, it was suggested he should receive the prize in a special ceremony at the Swedish embassy in Moscow. The Swedish government refused to accept this solution, since such a ceremony and the ensuing media coverage might upset the Soviet Union and damage Sweden's relations with the superpower. Instead, Solzhenitsyn received his prize at the 1974 ceremony after he had been deported from the Soviet Union.
The Gulag Archipelago was a three-volume work on the Soviet prison camp system. It was based upon Solzhenitsyn's own experience as well as the testimony of 227 former prisoners and Solzhenitsyn's own research into the history of the penal system. It discussed the system's origins from the founding of the Communist regime, with Lenin himself having responsibility, detailing interrogation procedures, prisoner transports, prison camp culture, prisoner uprisings and revolts, and the practice of internal exile. The appearance of the book in the West put the word gulag into the Western political vocabulary and guaranteed swift retribution from the Soviet authorities.
During this period, he was sheltered by the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who suffered considerably for his support of Solzhenitsyn and was eventually forced into exile himself.

As James F. Pontuso notes: It was at this critical moment after America‚Äôs loss in Vietnam that Solzhenitsyn emerged as a towering moral force opposing a policy of appeasement toward an evil adversary. The publication of The Gulag Archipelago, beginning in the 1970s, sounded the death knell of Communism, for in it Solzhenitsyn shows with stunning clarity how Karl Marx‚Äôs ideas had been the cause of Communism‚Äôs inevitable descent into totalitarianism. Solzhenitsyn‚Äôs pronouncements on East-West relations were so forceful that they dismayed and frightened many people in the West. He painted a particularly grim picture of the challenge facing Western civilization, arguing that Communism was a cancer that fed on the corpses of its victims while sapping strength from its adversaries in an effort to ensnare the entire world with its deadly doctrines. Meanwhile, he lamented the many people in the West, who, only half awake to the menace, were willing to sit idly by, content to amuse themselves with consumer goods, the bright and happy baubles of their materialistic culture.
Solzhenitsyn‚Äôs rhetoric worked and rallied many to his cause. It is no coincidence that after his revelations about the Soviet Union came to light, the once-powerful Communist parties of Western Europe lost their rank and file. Intellectuals, especially in France, abandoned hope of radically reforming political life and moved on to literary criticism, and Western voters in Germany, France, Great Britain, and the United States elected the most fiercely anti-Communist leaders of the Cold War era.
Ronald Reagan, Pope John Paul II, and Mikhail Gorbachev are often credited with ending the Cold War. Solzhenitsyn, meanwhile, gets almost no recognition for his role in Communism‚Äôs demise, either in the popular press or in intellectual circles. He has been called a religious fanatic, an anti-Semite, and a Russian nationalist blind to the merits of the West. After the collapse of Communism, the world‚Äôs most controversial writer suffered another kind of ignominy: neglect. His writings ignored as Russia ‚Äì along with the rest of the world ‚Äì has plunged headlong into an exuberant materialism in order to reap the profits made available by the opening of global markets. Here again Solzhenitsyn‚Äôs admonitions against unrestrained greed seem prescient. During the Cold War, Solzhenitsyn‚Äôs assessment of his homeland was suspect. Communist authorities denied his allegations, and people in West, although wary, thought them exaggerated. Solzhenitsyn‚Äôs account of brutality and terror was considered by some Westerners to be the ebullition of a disgruntled ex-prisoner intent on getting even with his tormentors; it was believed to be no more crucial to understanding the Soviet Union or Communism than a convict‚Äôs description of life in a Western penitentiary was needed to capture the essence of liberal democracy. After all, it was argued, Solzhenitsyn had been arrested during Joseph Stalin‚Äôs reign, spent a number of years in forced labor camps (the Gulag), suffered greatly during his imprisonment, and, upon his release, became a renowned dissident and a tenacious foe of the Soviet authorities. His readers naturally had to wonder whether his personal troubles had not biased his judgment.[21]
Solzhenitsyn has been proven correct. Secret police files made public since the collapse of Communism show that even the most apparently far-fetched anecdotes were true. As Solzhenitsyn maintained, the central fact of totalitarian Communism was atrocious cruelty. Nearly 30 million people died in the Gulag‚Äôs camps.[22]

On February 12, 1974, Solzhenitsyn was arrested and on the next day he was deported from the Soviet Union to Frankfurt, West Germany and stripped of his Soviet citizenship. The KGB had found the manuscript for the first part of The Gulag Archipelago and, less than a week later, Yevgeny Yevtushenko suffered reprisals for his support of Solzhenitsyn.
U.S. military attache William Odom managed to smuggle out a large portion of Solzhenitsyn's archive, including the author's membership card for the Writers' Union and Second World War military citations; Solzhenitsyn subsequently paid tribute to Odom's role in his memoir "Invisible Allies" (1995). [3]
In Germany, Solzhenitsyn lived in Heinrich B√∂ll's house in Cologne. He then moved to Zurich, Switzerland before Stanford University invited him to stay in the United States to "facilitate your work, and to accommodate you and your family." He stayed on the 11th floor of the Hoover Tower, part of the Hoover Institution, before moving to Cavendish, Vermont in 1976. He was given an honorary Literary Degree from Harvard University in 1978 and on Thursday, June 8, 1978 he gave his Commencement Address condemning, among other things, materialism in modern western culture.
Over the next 17 years, Solzhenitsyn worked on his cyclical history of the Russian Revolution of 1917, The Red Wheel. By 1992, four "knots" (parts) had been completed and he had also written several shorter works. Despite an enthusiastic welcome on his first arrival in America, followed by respect for his privacy, he had never been comfortable outside his homeland.[citation needed]
Despite spending two decades in the United States, Solzhenitsyn did not become fluent in spoken English. He had, however, been reading English-language literature since his teens, encouraged by his mother[citation needed]. More important, he resented the idea of becoming a media star and of tempering his ideas or ways of talking in order to suit television. Solzhenitsyn's warnings about the dangers of Communist aggression and the weakening of the moral fiber of the West were generally well received in Western conservative circles, alongside the tougher foreign policy pursued by U.S. President Ronald Reagan. At the same time, liberals and secularists became increasingly critical of what they perceived as his reactionary preference for Russian patriotism and the Russian Orthodox religion. Solzhenitsyn also harshly criticised what he saw as the ugliness and spiritual vapidity of the dominant pop culture of the modern West, including television and much of popular music: "...the human soul longs for things higher, warmer, and purer than those offered by today's mass living habits†... by TV stupor and by intolerable music."

In 1990, his Soviet citizenship was restored, and, in 1994, he returned to Russia with his wife, Natalia, who had become a United States citizen. Their sons stayed behind in the United States (later, his oldest son Yermolai returned to Russia to work for the Moscow office of a leading management consultancy firm). From then until his death, he lived with his wife in a dacha in Troitse-Lykovo (–¢—Ä–æ–∏—Ü–µ-–õ—ã–∫–æ–≤–æ) in west Moscow between the dachas once occupied by Soviet leaders Mikhail Suslov and Konstantin Chernenko.
The writer, however, deplored what he considered Russia's spiritual decline, increasingly adopting Western materialistic values, but in the last years of his life he praised President Vladimir Putin for Russia's revival.[citation needed]
After returning to Russia in 1994, Solzhenitsyn published eight two-part short stories, a series of contemplative "miniatures" or prose poems, a literary memoir on his years in the West (The Grain Between the Millstones).
All of Solzhenitsyn's sons became U.S. citizens. One, Ignat, has achieved acclaim as a pianist and conductor in the United States.

Solzhenitsyn died of heart failure near Moscow on August 3, 2008, at the age of 89.[23][24] A burial service was held at Donskoy Monastery, Moscow, on Wednesday, August 6, 2008.[25] He was buried on the same date at the place chosen by him in Donskoy necropolis.[26] Russian and world leaders paid tribute to Solzhenitsyn following his death.[27]
