Clerihew
A clerihew is a whimsical, four-line biographical poem invented by Edmund Clerihew Bentley. The lines are comically irregular in length, and the rhymes, often contrived, are structured AABB.

A clerihew has the following properties:
Clerihews are not satirical or abusive, but they target famous individuals and reposition them in an absurd or commonplace setting, often giving them an over-simplified and slightly garbled description (similar to the schoolboy style of 1066 and All That).
The unbalanced and unpolished poetic meter and line length parody the limerick, and the clerihew form also parodies the eulogy.

The form was invented by and is named after Edmund Clerihew Bentley. As a 16-year-old student at St Paul's School in London, Bentley invented the clerihew on Humphry Davy (see below) when the lines came to his mind during a science class,[1] and it was a great hit with his friends.[citation needed] The first use of the word in print was in 1928.[2] Clerihew published three volumes of his own clerihews, including Biography for Beginners (1905), which was published under the name "E. Clerihew".[1]
Bentley's friend, G. K. Chesterton, was also a practitioner of the clerihew and one of the sources of its popularity. Chesterton provided the illustrations for Biography for Beginners.[1] Other serious authors also produced clerihews, including W. H. Auden,[3] and it remains a popular humorous form among other writers and the general public.

The first ever clerihew was written about Sir Humphry Davy:
When this clerihew was published in 1905, "Was not fond of" was replaced by "Abominated". Other classic clerihews by Bentley included:
In 1983, Games Magazine ran a contest titled "Do You Clerihew?" The winning entry was:
