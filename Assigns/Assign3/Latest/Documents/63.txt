List of countries by GDP (nominal)
This article includes a list of countries of the world sorted by their gross domestic product (GDP), the marketvalue of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year. The GDP dollar estimates presented here are calculated at market or government official exchange rates.
Several economies which are not considered to be countries (world, EU, and some dependent territories) are included in the list because they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts here, but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison.
The first list includes 2005 datag for members of the International Monetary Fund, for which information is available. Data are in millions of current United States dollars. These figures do not include the following nations (but may be included in the World Bank or CIA listings): Somalia, Cuba, North Korea, Iraq, several small states in Europe (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, Liechtenstein, Vatican City) and the Pacific (Palau, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Tuvalu) or dependencies (Greenland).
The second list shows World Bank 2007 estimates, and the third list includes 2008 estimates from the CIA World Factbook.
