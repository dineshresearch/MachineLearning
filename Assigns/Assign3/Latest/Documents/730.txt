American exceptionalism
American exceptionalism (def. "exceptionalism") refers to the theory that the United States occupies a special niche among developed nations[1] in terms of its national credo, historical evolution, political and religious institutions and unique origins. The roots of the term are attributed to Alexis de Tocqueville,[2] who noted that the then-50-year-old United States held a special place among nations, because it was a country of immigrants and the first modern democracy. The term itself did not emerge until after World War II[3] when it was embraced by neoconservative[4] pundits in what was described in the International Herald Tribune as "an ugly twist of late".[5] The same article validates the original theory as one "based on our Constitution, our principles, our values and our ideals."[5] Research shows that "there is some indication for American exceptionalism among the [U.S.] public, but very little evidence of unilateral attitudes".[6]
The theory of American exceptionalism has a number of opponents, especially from the Left.[7] [8] They argue that the belief is "self-serving and jingoistic" (pointing out slavery and civil rights issues),[9] that it is based on a myth,[10]and that "[t]here is a growing refusal to accept" the idea of exceptionalism both nationally and internationally.[11] U.S. historians like Thomas Bender[12] also "try and put an end to the recent revival of American exceptionalism, a defect he esteems to be inherited from the Cold War".[13] G. W. Reichard and Ted Dickson argue[14] "how the development of the United States has always depended on its transactions with other nations for commodities, cultural values and populations", while Joseph Lepgold and Timothy McKeown "demonstrate that there is little or no basis to the claims that US foreign policy has differed greatly from that of other large nations".[15] Roger Cohen asks, "How exceptional can you be when every major problem you face, from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to gas prices, requires joint action?"[16]

In recent years, the term has also been used to describe an alleged phenomenon wherein certain political interests, to include the George W. Bush Administration, along with Americans subscribing to the political theory of neoconservativism, along with certain other US individuals and interests, allegedly view the United States as somehow being "above" or being an "exception" to the law, specifically the Law of Nations.[17] (This phenomenon might be called a priori exceptionalism or "neoexceptionalism".) Though this new use of the term has come into wide use in certain circles, it has served to confuse the topic and muddy the waters surrounding the traditional use of the term. This is due to the fact that a large number of persons who believe in what might be termed "traditional American exceptionalism" or a posteriori exceptionalism - the idea that America is a unique nation - that it differs qualitatively from the rest of the world - and has played a unique role in world history - also agree that the United States is and ought to be fully subject to and bound by the public international law. Individuals who subscribe to this point of view opine that America's exception is found in her history and behavior, not the laws she is subject to.

Dorothy Ross, in Origins of American Social Science (1991), argued that there are three generic varieties of American exceptionalism:
The concept was first used in respect of the United States by Alexis de Tocqueville in 1831 in his work Democracy in America:[21]
The position of the Americans is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one. Their strictly Puritanical origin, their exclusively commercial habits, even the country they inhabit, which seems to divert their minds from the pursuit of science, literature, and the arts, the proximity of Europe, which allows them to neglect these pursuits without relapsing into barbarism, a thousand special causes, of which I have only been able to point out the most important, have singularly concurred to fix the mind of the American upon purely practical objects. His passions, his wants, his education, and everything about him seem to unite in drawing the native of the United States earthward; his religion alone bids him turn, from time to time, a transient and distracted glance to heaven. Let us cease, then, to view all democratic nations under the example of the American people.[22]
American exceptionalism is close to the idea of Manifest Destiny[23], a term used by Jacksonian Democrats in the 1840s to promote the purchase of much of what is now the Western United States (the Oregon Territory, the Texas Annexation, the Gadsden Purchase, and the Mexican Cession). The concept of "manifest destiny" was later used in the 1890s by members of the Republican Party as a theoretical justification for the seizure and retention of former Spanish foreign colonies as the colonies and protectorates of the United States during the Spanish-American War of 1898. This short-lived phenomenon of classical colonial imperialism, was an arguably aberrational episode of US history that involved the occupation of the Philippines, as well as Puerto Rico, in addition to the establishment of a protectorate over Cuba, and an imperial adventure in Panama prior to the construction of the Panama Canal. This took place during a period from around 1898 to 1913 in the U.S. expansion outside of North America.
However, it must be noted that this colonialist phenomenon was quite limited in time and scope compared to practically all of the classical imperial powers, such as France, Imperial Japan, the United Kingdom, etc, who had extensive foreign empires lasting for centuries. On the contrary, the United States moved rapidly to grant home rule to and liquidate its acquisitions over the next several decades. At least in the case of Puerto Rico, she requested and received home rule in 1927, and changed her form of government in 1948 to that of a freely-associated Commonwealth retaining complete, unilateral, and popular self-determination over her own future. Since that point, Puerto Rico's people have voted in numerous referenda on free association - including the options of independence from the United States, statehood in the United States (as a sovereign and equal State thereof), as well as to remain freely associated with the United States; thus far, all votes have been in favor of free association with the United States (usually around 50% of votes), although a significant minority has always favored formalizing her association with the United States by becoming a full State thereof (between 35% to 45% of votes); those in favor of ending Puerto Rico's free association and declaring complete independence usually receive a small part of the vote (between 5% to 15% of votes).[24] The Philippines requested and received home rule in 1935, and subsequently declared independence in 1946, following the Second World War. The removal of the Cuban protectorate took place in phases stretching from the mid-1930s until the U.S.-supported overthrow of the brutal dictator Fulgencio Batista by Fidel Castro, who was believed to be a democrat, but subsequently made Cuba a protectorate of the USSR from 1959 to the end of the Cold War. Decolonization of the Panama Canal Zone took place over a period of some 30 years, ending in 2000 with the return of the American-built canal to the people of the Republic of Panama.
The basis most commonly cited for American exceptionalism is the idea that the United States and its people differ from other nations, at least on a historical basis, as an association of people who came from numerous places throughout the world but who hold a common bond in standing for certain self-evident truths, like freedom, inalienable natural and human rights, democracy, republicanism, the rule of law, civil liberty, civic virtue, the common good, fair play, private property, and Constitutional government; and that through these values America diverged from the rest of the world at least during its early years.[citation needed]. Of course, America as it is does not reflect the fulfillment of these ideals in whole, but most Americans throughout history have viewed these as goals to work for, to live for, and to fight for. The term is also used by United States citizens to indicate that America and Americans have different states of mind, different surroundings, and different political cultures than other nations, and still others use it to refer to the American dream and the slow yet continuous journey of the people of the United States, sharing a nation and a destiny, to build a more perfect union, to live up to the dreams, hopes, and ideals of its founders, so that "these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from this Earth."[25]
Researchers and academics, however, generally use the term "American exceptionalism" to strictly mean sharp and measurable differences in public opinion and political behavior between Americans and their counterparts in other developed democracies.
Persons who are not supporters of the theory of American exceptionalism often argue that it is equivalent to ethnocentrism[citation needed] or jingoism and nationalist propaganda.[26][27] In their arguments, they often compare the US to other countries that have claimed an exceptional nature or destiny. Examples in more recent times include Great Britain at the height of the British Empire, the USSR and Nazi Germany, while many historic empires such as Ancient Rome, China, and a wide range of minor kingdoms and tribes have also embraced exceptionalism. In each case, a basis was presented as to why the country was exceptional compared to all other countries, drawing upon circumstance, cultural background and mythos, and self-perceived national aims.
However, it is also claimed that this view of American exceptionalism as nationalistic propaganda is markedly incorrect, because American exceptionalism, as a phenomenon, means qualitative differences from other nations, not superiority over them. One example of the nature of this exceptionalism (as in difference) is that all of the nations mentioned in the previous example were societies based on an exclusive ethnic group, or an exclusive ethnic group as first-class citizens within those societies: the Romans, in the case of Ancient Rome; the British, in the case of the British Empire; "Aryans" in the case of the Nazi entity; etc. Compared to these states, the United States is fundamentally different; it may be British in origin[28], but is not very British today, aside from the more or less (See American English and British English differences) shared English language, and certain shared, ancient, traditional customs and structures. Today the U.S. is a amalgamated pluricentric multiethnic polity, consisting of citizens of many ethnicities: Native American, Alaska Native, Pacific Islander, English, African (including Cape Verdean-Americans, Liberian-Americans, Ghanaian-Americans, South African-Americans, Kenyan-Americans, and Nigerian-Americans, among many others), Scottish, Welsh, Irish, French, German, Jewish, Polish, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Greek, Hungarian, Czech, Scandinavian (including Icelandic-Americans, Norwegian-Americans, Danish-Americans, Swedish-Americans, and Finnish Americans), English Canadian and French Canadian, Filipino, Somali, Ethiopian, Armenian, Russian, Serbian, Albanian, Croatian, Bosnian, Romanian, Roma, Bulgarian, Ukrainian, Turkish, Middle Eastern, Latino and Hispanic (including Salvadorian-Americans, Cuban-Americans, Mexican-Americans, Colombian-Americans, Venezuelan-Americans and Brazilian-Americans), Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Afghan, Tibetan, Iranian, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi - in essence, a sample of all mankind, many of whom remember their ethnic heritage, yet proudly describe themselves as Americans, and share a common citizenship, a common compact, a common land, and a common destiny.
This exceptionalism in difference may even be considered to extend beyond the synthesis of ethnicities that America represents: it can also speak to a shared experience. Unlike the empires of the past, it can be said that Americans do not believe they are the "Chosen P
