Steorn
Steorn Ltd. is a small privately held technology development company based in Dublin, Ireland.
The company attracted mainstream media attention in August 2006 by placing a full-page advertisement in The Economist claiming it had developed a technology that produces "free, clean, and constant energy" and challenging the scientific community to test it.[2][a] In December 2006 the company announced it had chosen a jury of scientists to make such tests.[3]
Steorn says its technology, named Orbo, violates the law of conservation of energy,[4] a fundamental principle of physics.[5] To date, no evidence confirming that the technology works has been made available to the public.

Steorn was founded in 2000[6] and, in October 2001, their website stated that they were a "specialist service company providing programme management and technical assessment advice for European companies engaging in e-commerce projects". Steorn (pronounced /ËˆstjÉ”rn/ in English) is a Norse word meaning to guide or manage.
In May 2006, The Sunday Business Post reported that Steorn was a former dot.com business which was developing a microgenerator product based on the same principle as kinetic energy generators in watches, as well as creating ecommerce websites for customers. The company had also recently raised about â‚¬2.5 million from "high net worth individuals", and was three years into a four year development plan for its microgenerator technology.[7] Steorn has since stated that the account given in this interview was part of a "crisis management plan" to prevent a leak regarding their free energy technology.[8]

Steorn's accounts for the year ending 31 December 2003,[9] show that the company's Profit and Loss Account had an accumulated loss of â‚¬192,661, while its cash reserves were â‚¬94. A revision of the company's web site on February 9, 2007 included an informal summary of the company's accounts as of 2006.[1] The summary shows pre-tax losses of â‚¬779,047, â‚¬1,815,666, and â‚¬3,247,938 in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively.
The company's investment history shows share allotments for cash in August 2000, January 2001, March 2001, March 2004, then several rounds in December 2004, and one in October 2005.[9] The investments amount to â‚¬3 million in total.[7] According to the Sunday Tribune, Steorn secured over â‚¬8m in funding from a range of investors to continue its research in 2006. Its most recent accounts for that year also reveal that it had accumulated losses of â‚¬5.9m by that year. According to its 2006 accounts, which were provided by the company, Steorn's two directors, SeÃ¡n McCarthy and Michael Daly, shared over â‚¬350,000 in remuneration in 2006. Wages and salaries for 13 staff, including the directors, totalled a further â‚¬988,000.[10]

In August 2006, Steorn placed an advertisement in The Economist to publicise its free-energy technology.[2] A press release "issued a challenge to the global scientific community" to validate its claims.[11] Steorn reported that, within hours of its advertisement, it was contacted by hundreds of scientists worldwide and many thousands of other interested people.[12]
Steorn's Economist advertisement said:
We have developed a technology that produces free, clean and constant energy. Our technology has been independently validated by engineers and scientistsâ€”always behind closed doors, always off the record, always proven to work.[2]
Steorn said that "free" meant that "the energy produced is done so without recourse to external sources", "clean" meant that "during operation the technology produces no emissions", and "constant" meant that "with the exception of mechanical failure the technology will continue to operate indefinitely". Steorn said any technology including all three of these factors would be a violation of the principle of conservation of energy.[4]
At the time of the initial announcement Steorn said their technology, which would be available for license under the brand name "Orbo",[13] had already been found to work by eight independent scientists and engineers "with multiple PhDs from world-class universities" but that none of them were willing to publish their results for fear of becoming embroiled in a controversy.[14] The company has declined to name these scientists, citing mutually binding non-disclosure agreements.[14]

Steorn's advertisement in The Economist was intended to attract the attention of the world's leading scientists working in the field of experimental physics, challenging them to test their free energy technology.[11][15] It intended that 12 scientists would be invited to take part in a rigorous testing exercise to prove that Steornâ€™s technology creates free energy and to publish the results worldwide.[11]
On 1 December 2006, Steorn announced that a jury had been selected and had signed contracts, although their identities were not released.[3] The validation process reportedly began in January 2007[16] but no reports on the progress of the validation process have been released to date.

On 4 July 2007, an example of the technology was to be displayed at the Kinetica Museum, Spitalfields Market, London. A unit constructed of clear plastic was prepared so that the arrangement of magnets could be seen and to demonstrate that the device operated without external power sources.[17][18] The public demonstration was delayed and then cancelled because of technical difficulties. Steorn initially thought that the problems had been caused by "excessive heat from the lighting in the main display area"[18][19] but later blamed the failure on damage done to bearings due to a greenhouse effect within the box.[20]

On 4 February 2009, Steorn announced that they were beginning commercialisation of their technology and asked for 300 engineers and engineering organisations to sign up to a testing process to be completed by the end of 2009.[21] They also released a video of three engineers saying that, having witnessed an experiment and studied the testing equipment and software generating output graphs, they were generally supportive of Steorn's excess energy claims.[22] Following these announcements, Steorn were criticised for their continued failure to provide a public, working demonstration[23] or to release information without non-disclosure and licensing agreements.[24]

No specific details of the workings of the claimed technology have been made public. SeÃ¡n McCarthy has stated in an RTÃ‰ radio interview that, "What we have developed is a way to construct magnetic fields so that when you travel round the magnetic fields, starting and stopping at the same position, you have gained energy... The energy isn't being converted from any other source such as the energy within the magnet. It's literally created. Once the technology operates it provides a constant stream of clean energy."[25]
The device has been reported to be a motor that uses magnets, but no electromagnets.[26] Following a meeting between McCarthy and Professor Sir Eric Ash in July 2007, Ash reported that "the Orbo is a mechanical device which uses powerful magnets on the rim of a rotor and further magnets on an outer shell"[27]
In a demonstration to The Guardian at Steorn's office in August 2006, a computer display reported the device to have an efficiency of 285 percent. Steorn say that they have measured efficiencies of up to 400 percent[14] and that the technology is scalable to almost any size, powering anything from a flashlight to an aeroplane.[28]

Steorn claims to violate the law of conservation of energy, a fundamental principle of physics[5] which they have referred to as scientific dogma.[27] In response, Sir Eric Ash has said that there is no flexibility in choosing to accept that energy is always conserved since rejecting conservation of energy would undermine all science and technology.[27] Following a July 2007 meeting with McCarthy, Ash formed the opinion that McCarthy was truly convinced in the validity of his invention, but that this conviction was a case of "prolonged self deception".[27]
Steorn describes their technology as "a way to construct magnetic fields so that when you travel round the magnetic fields, starting and stopping at the same position, you have gained energy".[5] Barry Williams of the Australian Skeptics has pointed out that Steorn is "not the first company to claim they have suddenly discovered the miraculous property of magnetism that allows you to get free energy".[5]
Eric Berger, writing on the Houston Chronicle website, commented that:
Recall that Steorn is a former e-business company that saw its market vanish during the dot.com bust. It stands to reason that Steorn has re-tooled as a Web marketing company, and is using the "free energy" promotion as a platform to show future clients how it can leverage print advertising and a slick Web site to promote their products and ideas. If so, it's a pretty brilliant strategy.[29]
