Photographic printing
Photographic printing is the process of producing a final image on paper for viewing, using chemically sensitized paper. The paper is exposed to a photographic negative, a positive transparency (or slide), or a digital image file projected using an enlarger or digital exposure unit such as a LightJet printer. Alternatively, the negative or transparency may be placed atop the paper and directly exposed, creating a contact print.
Following exposure, the paper is processed to reveal and make permanent the latent image.

The process consists of four major steps, performed in a photographic darkroom or within an automated photo printing machine. These steps are:
Optionally, after fixing, the print is treated with a hypo clearing agent to ensure complete removal of the fixer, which would otherwise compromise the long term stability of the image. Prints can be chemically toned or hand coloured after processing. [1]

Colour papers require specific chemical processing in proprietary chemicals. Today's processes are called RA-4, which is for printing colour negatives, and Ilfochrome, which is for printing colour transparencies.

Digital photography allows, even encourages people to take more photographs. Most of these photos will be viewed on computer monitors, televisions, Digital photo frames, and online Photo sharing sites. Some will be printed at home using Inkjet printers and more specialized Photo printers. For true Photographic prints, image files can be taken to “1 hour” photo finishing locations which have digital minilabs or uploaded to Online photo finishing sites which then mail you your prints. Some Chain stores combine these services allowing you to upload your pictures and specify which local store you want to pick the prints up at one hour later.
